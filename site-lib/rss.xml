Modular (-)operads provide a (coherent) algebraic way to encode the gluing operations of connected surfaces. In particular, the bordism ()-category provides a special kind of modular operad whose algebras are topological field theories, where taking algebras in the symmetric monoidal -category of -linear categories recovers Segal's notion of modular functors, used in his approach to conformal field theories. If instead the algebras are taken in the derived category of chain complexes over , then one obtains a structure closely related to Witten's notion of cohomological field theories. In this talk we aim to provide an example driven introduction to modular (-)operads and their appearance in the study of topological field theories.
Goal: Provide an example driven introduction to modular -operads in the study of TFTs using the language of Segal conditions.In this talk we aim to provide an example driven introduction to modular -operads and their application in the study of TFTs. In order to accomplish this we use the language of Segal conditions for -operads, which provides an elegant generalization to modular and cyclic -operads. The primary references for this note are the talk notes of Steinebrunner<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-1-4c3215d925329aa0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a> and Marci Robertson in the Copenhagen Masterclass<a data-footref="2" href="#fn-2-4c3215d925329aa0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a>. We also pull some descriptions from<a data-footref="3" href="#fn-3-4c3215d925329aa0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a>.Note: We will work 1-categorically for the most part, though wherever appears it can be replaced by the -category of spaces to obtain the -categorical version, modulo the inclusion of certain completeness restrictions.When working with higher algebraic structure, especially algebraic structure which is homotopical in nature, such as that associated with cohomological field theories, it is beneficial to have concrete combinatorial descriptions of your data for the sake of computations. Note that (-)categories are modelled on the idea that we have elementary structures, given by objects and arrows , and that we have compositional structure allowing us to build an arrow from a sequence of arrows , where when this is the same as an object . One can think of a category as a collection of sets indexed by these structures, which corresponds to a functor , satisfying the additional gluing requirementKey Idea: Algebraic/Categorical structures are given by specifying data on elementary shapes, and then specifying structure by relations on gluings of the elementary shapes.The idea of operads come from generalizing this perspective to the structure needed to encode common occurrences of algebraic data:Example (i) A monoid consists of an object , a multiplication operation , and a unit operation for the multiplication such that it satisfies associativity and unitality (ii) A left module consists a pair of a monoid object and an object together with additional operation satisfying associativity With these examples in mind, a first approach to studying algebraic structures could be to take our basic shapes to be trees:<br><img src="images/svg-cache/a70e465243b962129a1b5290b59130e7.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">Here the basic shape of an edge represents our objects, while corollas between edges represent our morphisms. It turns out that if we take the input edges to a corolla to be ordered this gives us non-symmetric operads, while if we our edges to be non-ordered this gives us symmetric operads. In this talk the main important case will be that of symmetric operads, which are indexed by the category of trees. A tree will be described by a polynomial^ffbb7c
where is the set of edges, is the set of vertices, is the set of vertices with a choice of incoming edge, and are the natural projections, and sends a vertex to its unique outgoing edge.
Note: All vertices have a unique outgoing edge, though not all vertices need have an incoming edge (and edges need not have two vertices)
<br>Tree

This defines the inert Dendroidal category . Given a tree we can obtain another polynomialwhere is the set of subtrees of , and is the set of subtrees of with a marked leaf. Then one can describe maps in as a map of such polynomials, which is determined by where we send vertices in . The inert morphisms are the subtree inclusions while the active morphisms are those preserving the boundary (i.e. leaves go to leaves and roots go to roots).Example
For , the -corolla is the tree while the plain edge is the tree We write for the full subcategory spanned by those elementary objects.
An operad is then a pre-sheaf which preserves the gluing data, which is to say that for a tree , we haveOperads are meant to encode coherent operations for algebraic structure. To obtain algebraic objects with these given operations we need to define the notion of algebras over an operad. For this we use the fact that (symmetric) monoidal categories are important examples of operads. Indeed, for a (symmetric) monoidal category its underlying operad sends the plain edge to the set of objects in and the -corolla to the set with fibersAlgebras Over an Operad
An algebra over an operad valued in a (symmetric) monoidal category is a map of operads We write for the category of -algebras in .
Let's considered the case of a non-coloured operad , so that . Then an -algebra in consists of an object together with for each -ary operation in , an operationwhere if is a symmetric operad these maps are required to be -fixed points in .Little Disks Operad
For each we have the little -disks operad has -ary operations given by embeddings In higher categorical contexts these operads interpolate between associative monoids and commutative monoids .
These are actually an example of objects with more algebraic structure than operads. Such additional algebraic structure is important for specifying structures like Hopf algebras which come with both operations as well as co-operations . A straightforward generalization of the diagram shapes for operads then leads us to the notion of (symmetric) properads, where instead of rooted trees we look at directed acyclic graphs. To define directed acyclic graphs it will be helpful to use the notion of undirected graphs:Undirected Graphs with Loose Ends
An undirected graph with loose ends is a diagram of finite sets where is a fixed-point free involution and the map is a monomorphism. Here is the set of arcs of , is the set of vertices, and is the boundary of , while the set of edges is the set of pairs (i.e. is the set of -orbits).
To each undirected graph we can associate its geometric realization, and we say is connected if this topological space is connected. For two connected undirected graphs , an embedding consists of a map of diagrams such that is injective, preserves the involution, and arises as the pullback of along . We write for the set of isomorphism classes of embeddings of graphs in .
Note: This is analogous to the inert maps for trees, though we don't have an additional map from vertices back to edges since there is no notion of an inward or outward edge
We write for the set of isomorphism classes of embeddings of graphs in . We can identify the set of edges of with the set of embeddings of in and the set of vertices with the set of embeddings of for all . In particular we have inclusions .Graph Map
Let be connected undirected graphs. A graph map consists of (i) an involution preserving function (ii) a function such that (a) sends edges to edges
(b) preserves unions and takes vertex disjoint pairs to vertex disjoint pairs
(c) is boundary-compatible The category then has connected undirected graphs as objects and graph maps as morphisms which compose by composing the component functions.Active-Inert Factorization
A graph map in is active if , and inert if the composite factors through .
In the latter case we obtain the notion of an embedding discussed previously. We can then define the directed graphs via the pullback:Directed Acyclic Graphs
The category of directed graphs is the pullback so that a directed graph is a graph together with a splitting of as . The category of directed acyclic graphs is the full subcategory on those directed graphs that do not have directed cycles.
The elementary objects of are the directed edge and the directed corollas for all (here is obtained from by orienting it in such a way that it has incoming and outgoing edges). The induced active and inert morphisms have Segal objects the properads.An important example of a properad is that associated to a symmetric monoidal -category . The value at a graph is the space of all labellings of by in the following sense:
A labelling assigns to each edge of an object and to each vertex a morphism whose source is the tensor product of labels edges entering and whose target is the tensor product of labels of edges exiting .
Functoriality with respect to inert maps is given by forgetting the labelling associated to pre-images of . The functoriality with respect to edge contractions is given by composing morphisms, and the functoriality with respect to subdivisions is by introducing identity morphisms.
Monoidal Envelope for Properads
There is an adjunction that has properties discussed below.
To begin describing , recall that the free commutative monoid monad is defined byThen the objects of are freely generated by the colours of whereas the morphisms are freely generated by the operations of :]]></description><link>board-talks/lectures/tfts-via-cyclic-and-modular-infinity-operads.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Board Talks/Lectures/TFTs via Cyclic and Modular Infinity Operads.md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="images/svg-cache/a70e465243b962129a1b5290b59130e7.svg" length="0" type="image/svg+xml"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="images/svg-cache/a70e465243b962129a1b5290b59130e7.svg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No title]]></title><link>board-talks/seminars/ambidexterity-seminar/applications-and-examples-in-equivariant-poincare-duality.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Board Talks/Seminars/Ambidexterity Seminar/Applications and Examples in Equivariant Poincare Duality.md</guid></item><item><title><![CDATA[No title]]></title><link>board-talks/seminars/ambidexterity-seminar/twisted-ambidexterity-via-spivak-data.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Board Talks/Seminars/Ambidexterity Seminar/Twisted Ambidexterity via Spivak Data.md</guid></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reading Plan for Ambidexterity Seminar (Fall 2025)]]></title><description><![CDATA[We will be starting with section 2 of Shachar et al.'s paper on Ambidexterity and Height<a data-footref="11" href="#fn-1-4c3215d925329aa0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a>, before moving into the initial main reference, which will be the first part of Bastiaan Cnossen's thesis<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-2-4c3215d925329aa0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a>, with other references/possible directions being Hilman, Kirstein, and Kremer's generalization of twisted ambidexterity in<a data-footref="8" href="#fn-3-4c3215d925329aa0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a>, as well as applications of ordinary ambidexterity to chromatic homotopy theory in<a data-footref="10" href="#fn-4-4c3215d925329aa0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a>.

Similarly, is the full-subcategory spanned by stable presentable -categories.
A space is -finite for , if and is contractible, or , the set is finite, and all fibers of the diagonal are -finite5 -finite or -finite, if it is -finite for some integer . For we write for the full subcategory spanned by -finite spaces.
-space, for a prime, if all the homotopy groups of are -groups. Given an -category , For every map of spaces , we write for the pullback functor and and for the left and right adjoints of (i.e. given by left and right Kan extension, respectively), whenever they exist
Under the equivalence , we will identify a space with its map to the terminal object, so that above we would write instead of for , and similarly for the others
For each , we write , and write for the co-unit (called the fold). Similarly, we write and write for the unit (called the diagonal) Given a map of spaces , and , we write for the homotopy fiber of over . We say that: An -category admits -limits (resp. -colimits) if it admits all limits (resp. colimits) of shape for all A functor preserves -limits (resp. preserves -colimits) if it preserves all limits (resp. colimits) of shape for all For every -finite (co)limits refer to (co)limits indexed by an -finite space
We write (resp. ) for the subcategory spanned by -categories admitting -finite colimits (resp. limits) and functors preserving them.
For (resp. ) We wrote (resp. ) for the full subcategory of spanned by -finite colimit (resp. limit) preserving functors
We write for the subcategory spanned by the -semiadditive -categories and -semiadditive (i.e. -finite colimit preserving) functors.
Given an -operad , we say is compatible with -indexed colimits for some collection of -categories if the underlying -category admits -indexed colimits and every tensor operation of preserves -indexed colimits in each variable
An -semiadditively -monoidal -category is an -monoidal -semiadditive -category which is compatible with -finite colimits Q. What does this mean?
If is a monoidal -category and is an -category enriched in , we write for the -mapping object of . When is closed, we write for . For every -category we write . The importance of -finite maps and spaces lies in their use as indexing -categories for diagrams that we are interested in comparing limits and colimits of. Specifically, the in -semiadditivity indicates the size of the -finite spaces for which we have norm mapswhich are equivalences. Let's begin with the basic notion of ambidexterity in chromatic homotopy theory.Ambidexterity of -finite Maps
Let . A -finite map is called: weakly -ambidextrous if it is an equivalence, or is -ambidextrous
-ambidextrous if it is weakly -ambidextrous, admits all -limits and -colimits, and the norm map is an equivalence. A -finite map, i.e. an equivalence, is always -ambidextrous. If is -finite, then the diagonalis -finite and the ambidexterity of allows in turn the definition of .The property of being -ambidextrous is preserved by pullbacks and determined by its fibers. Since the fibers of the diagonal are path spaces of , is weakly -ambidextrous if and only if the path spaces of are -ambidextrous. This begins the inductive construction since the path-space reduces from an -finite space to an -finite space.Prop: Characterization of -Ambidextrous Morphism
Let be an -category and let be a -finite map. The map is -ambidextrous if and only if the following hold: is weakly -ambidextrous admits all -limits and -colimits
Either preserves all -colimits or preserves all -limits. Proof Idea.
From the discussion above, we can assume wlog that . The forward implication is immediate due to the norm equivalence, so it suffices to show that if (1)-(3) hold, then the norm map is an equivalence. ***Prop: Closure of Ambidexterity under -category constructions
Let be an -category and let be a -finite -ambidextrous space. The space is also -ambidextrous for (1) (2) for an -category
(3) containing the final object and closed under -limits for all and (4) containing the initial object and closed under -colimits for all and . Note: Here is the -fold based loop space at .The first two properties are classical, while the last two are dual and follow from the inductive construction of norm maps.Important
The main feature of ambidexterity is that it allows us to integrate families of morphisms in . That is, given a -ambidextrous map and , we have a map which can be given by the composite When we can think of an element of as a map , and as the sum of over points of . Explicitly, the identification of mapping spaces comes from the equivalences Intuition for Induction: For a space and a diagram , to specify a norm map is to specify a homotopy coherently compatible collection of morphisms , for . always provides a family of candidates for these maps, , but a-priori there is no coherent choice for them which can be made. But, if we can integrate over the spaces , we can just takeWhen is constant on some object , then the Norm map is the same as a map of spaces , where the above construction specializes to .Important
The initial claim comes from the natural equivalences where is the whiskering of , while is the whiskering of . Thus, we have a natural equivalence Thus, the data of a map is equivalent to the data of a map of simplicial sets such that and .
Further, in the case when is the constant functor at some . In this case, the data of a map is equivalent to the data of a map of simplicial sets such that . A natural family of such transformations is then a map of simplicial sets such that .
More generally, if has all -shaped (co)limits, so that we have functors , then the natural equivalences we want are given by using adjoints and (co)continuity of the diagonal:Thus, a family of norms is equivalent to a natural transformation .Similarly, if has all -shaped (co)limits for , so that exist, then we have natural maps<br>where is the natural equivalence coming from , and the center map uses the <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories" data-href="Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/calculus-of-mates-for-infinity-categories.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">mate calculus</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories" data-href="Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/calculus-of-mates-for-infinity-categories.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">mate calculus</a> on this transformation to obtain . If this Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence, then it follows that the data of a norm is equivalent to the data of a natural transformation . Since the square in which appears is a homotopy pullback square of -groupoids, and hence we can assume without loss of generality that is a Kan fibration, the square is exact, and hence it satisfies the Beck-Chevalley condition (c.f. Chapter 13 of<a data-footref="4" href="#fn-4-4c3215d925329aa0" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[4]</a>).Inductive Approach: If is an -finite space, then the path spaces are -finite. Thus, if inductively we have invertible canonical norm maps for all -finite spaces , then we obtain a canonical way to integrate -finite families of morphisms, which allows us to define norm maps for all -finite spaces. Whether all these new norm maps are isomorphisms is now a property, which if holding let's us continue the induction:
() We define every -category to be -semiadditive. Recall that the -finite spaces are the contractible ones, and the canonical norm map is hence an equivalence, being equivalent to the identity transformation on . This just says we can canonically sum a one point family of maps.
() The only non-contractible -finite space is . The associated norm map is the unique map from the initial object to the terminal object of , which always exists. Thus, is -semiadditive if and only if it is pointed. This allows integration of empty families of morphisms, which is to say that for any , we get a canonical zero map given by the composition () Let be an -finite space, and suppose is -semiadditive. Then in particular we have an equivalence , which corresponds to a wrong-way co-unit and a wrong-way unit , so that we can define the map which from the discussion preceding the induction is equivalent to a norm map , which is given by where the Beck-Chevalley transformation can be written as the composite As a first example, in the step is equivalent to a set, so we can replace by a set if necessary. Then is precisely a set of objects in indexed by those in , and is the matrix of objects with and when , and similarly is the matrix of objects with and with . On the other hand, and are matrices with constant rows and constant columns, respectively. The compositeis given precisely by the matrix of maps with , while for , is the unique composite through the zero object. The norm map is then the compositeAs a secon d example, if we're doing the step with a connected -finite space, so that for some finite group , then . Write for the unique map to the point.

It suffices to prove that preserves -finite colimits. By the description of colimits in spans it suffices to prove that is stable under -finite colimits.
Question
How can we see that has -finite colimits? If is an -finite diagram, then How do we know that is also -finite? We know that is -finite and that all fibers of the Kan fibration are -finite, so it is also an -finite map. Do -finite maps compose?
The following answers the above question:Prop: -finite Maps Compose

Proof.
Taking fibers, it suffices to show that if is an -finite map with an -finite space, then is also -finite. For each point , we have a homotopy fiber sequence where is also -finite, by definition of -finite maps. Thus, looking at the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for each , we see that is also -truncated, has finitely many path components, and has all homotopy groups begin finite, completing the proof.

We have the following universal example of an -semiadditive -category:Universal Case
For the symmetric monoidal -category of spans is the universal -semiadditive -category.

Homotopy Cardinality
For a -finite space , the homotopy cardinality of is the rational number We say an -category is semirational if it is -semiadditive (i.e. -finite spaces are -ambidextrous, which are contractible, empty, and discrete spaces) and for each , multiplication by is invertible in (e.g. or ). Here multiplication by on an object is given by the cardinality , which is the composite A semirational -category which admits all -finite colimits is automatically -semiadditive, and for every -finite space , we have that its cardinality is its homotopy cardinality: This comes from the fact that the cardinality is additive, and for every fiber sequence of -finite spaces where is connected, . In Chromatic homotopy theory we often come across examples of -semiadditive -categories of higher height. For a given prime , and , let be the Morava -theory spectrum of height at the prime . We have that the localizations and are -semiadditive. For , , and the cardinalities recover the homotopy cardinality. Similarly, since is -local for all , if is a -finite space whose homotopy groups have cardinality prime to , then the -local cardinality of coincides with the homotopy cardinality for all by the previous example. However, this does not hold in general for -finite spaces whose cardinality is not prime to .To study the -local cardinalities of -finite spaces, it is useful to consider their image in Morava -theory. For , let be the Morava -theory associated with some formal group of height over , viewed as an object of . In particular, we have a (non-canonical) isomorphismChromatic Cardinality
The -category is -semiadditive by Theorem 5.3.1 in6, and hence we can consider cardinalities of -finite spaces in . The -typical height cardinality of a -finite space is defined to be For we can identify with , and so can recover the homotopy cardinality. For , let be the -adic free loop space of . It turns out that belongs to the subring and satisfies . Applying this inductively we see that for the -typical height cardinality in terms of the homotopy cardinality. If is a -space, then coincides with the ordinary loop space.
Question
How can we show that when is a -space? Hint: First consider the universal examples . The following gives another family of examples of higher semiadditive -categories:Prop: is -semiadditive
For every the -category is -semiadditive.
Categorical Cardinality
Let and let . For every -finite space , the -semiadditive structure of gives rise to a functor . When , is given by taking the constant colimit on . Since preserves limits, and hence is -semiadditive, the same claim holds for .
Conversely, the -semiadditive structure on is given by taking limits of constant diagrams.(co)Cartesian -commutative Monoid Structure
For , since is freely generated from a point under -finite colimits, we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cocartesian structure. Dually, for , we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cartesian structure.
The full subcategory is closed under colimits, and in particular is -semiadditive, since the inclusion admits the right adjoint .Recall that for a symmetric monoidal -category with subcategory spanned by dualizable objects, every admits a trace or Euler characteristic given by the compositewhere the symmetrizer in the center can be thought of as the analogue of our norm map in this context. For example, if , and , then is the Euler characteristic of the finite space (here finite is in the sense of -compactness, which is equivalent to being weakly equivalent to a finite CW complex).On the other hand, in the context of -ambidexterity for a -finite map and a (co)complete -category (or at least finitely complete with sufficient limits and colimits so the following adjunctions exist), we look at the adjunctions where is pullback, is left Kan extension along , and is right Kan extension along . When is the point, becomes the diagonal, , and . The Norm map is then a natural comparison map (which need not always exist)which in the case of -ambidexterity of is an equivalence, along with all the associated norm maps for diagonal of . The cardinality for a -ambidextrous map then defines an analogue of the trace in the case of symmetric monoidal -categoriesFor example, if is the infinity category of spectra, then we can use the natural equivalence<br>(c.f. <a data-href="Universality of Multiplicative Infinite Loop Space Machines (Gepner, Groth, Nikolaus)#^5eab9d" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/homotopy-algebras/universality-of-multiplicative-infinite-loop-space-machines-(gepner,-groth,-nikolaus).html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Universality of Multiplicative Infinite Loop Space Machines (Gepner, Groth, Nikolaus) &gt; ^5eab9d</a><a data-href="Universality of Multiplicative Infinite Loop Space Machines (Gepner, Groth, Nikolaus)#^5eab9d" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/homotopy-algebras/universality-of-multiplicative-infinite-loop-space-machines-(gepner,-groth,-nikolaus).html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Universality of Multiplicative Infinite Loop Space Machines (Gepner, Groth, Nikolaus) &gt; ^5eab9d</a>) to observe that being cocontinuous means we can write it as , so that Thus, for any -finite map, the -cardinality of corresponds to an integer, where for , is given by the compositewhere we're identifying with the integer value.To begin let's consider the case of a finite group so that is a -finite space, and take for a commutative unital ring . Then is the category of -valued -representations for a commutative ring . The map is given by sending an -module to the trivial representation associated to it. On the other hand, sends a -representation to the -module of -orbits, and sends a -representation to the -module of -fixed points. We then have a natural norm mapThe kernel of this map consists of those -orbits such that , while the image always at least contains . The norm map fits in the Tate cohomology groups which are defined byRecall here that , and that are the right derived functors of the fixed point functor, while , and are the left derived functors. We can also describe the group cohomology as the cohomology of the cochain complex associated to the simplicial -module , with face operators given by multiplying arguments internally, or acting on the left/right (with right action being trivial), and degeneracies given by inserting identities.Example
Consider the case of and . Then is just multiplication by , implying that but .
Example
If is a commutative ring and is a group with , then is multiplication by , and hence is an isomorphism. In particular, the norm map for any constant representation is an isomorphism.
Example
If , , and with the action given by the inclusion , then is the space of homotopy orbits, while is the space of homotopy fixed points, so we would never have the norm map being an isomorphism.
If is a map of finite groups, and is a commutative ring such that is a unit, then and are our Kan extensions, where is given the right -module structure , and is given the left -module structure where on basis elements .The norm map is given on a simple tensor by the -equivariant homomorphism sending to , which is equivariant since maps toIn general, maps toThe inverse is the map sending a -equivariant map to . This is -equivariant sinceTo see that these are inverse first note thatwhile is mapped to the map which at is given byLet be a finite group and let be the unique -finite map of spaces. Let be the -category of spectra so that is the homotopy orbits functor and is the homotopy fixed points functor. Equivalently, and , where here we're using that is tensored and cotensored over , being complete and cocomplete. Explicitly, for a spectrum , is the -equivariant mapping spectrum and with diagonal action.

It turns out that belongs to the subring and satisfies . Applying this inductively we see that for the -typical height cardinality in terms of the homotopy cardinality. If is a -space, then coincides with the ordinary loop space.
Question
How can we show that when is a -space? Hint: First consider the universal examples . The following gives another family of examples of higher semiadditive -categories:Prop: is -semiadditive
For every the -category is -semiadditive.
Categorical Cardinality
Let and let . For every -finite space , the -semiadditive structure of gives rise to a functor . When , is given by taking the constant colimit on . Since preserves limits, and hence is -semiadditive, the same claim holds for .
Conversely, the -semiadditive structure on is given by taking limits of constant diagrams.(co)Cartesian -commutative Monoid Structure
For , since is freely generated from a point under -finite colimits, we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cocartesian structure. Dually, for , we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cartesian structure.
The full subcategory is closed under colimits, and in particular is -semiadditive, since the inclusion admits the right adjoint .We will explore the notion of semiadditive height, as well as its relation to other classical notions of height. The definition of height will depend on a choice of a prime , and a -typical version of -semiadditivity where we use -finite -spaces rather than all -finite spaces. -Spaces
Recall that a space is a -space if and only if all its homotopy groups are -torsion (i.e. for each , and each , there exists such that ). When has finite homotopy groups, this implies that they are -groups (i.e. their order is a power of ).
-Typical Semiadditivity
Let be a prime and . We say that An -category is -typically -semiadditive if all -finite -spaces are -ambidextrous.
A functor between such is -typically -semadditive if it preserves all -finite -space colimits (or equivalently limits).
An -monoidal -category for an -operad is -typically -semiadditively -monoidal if it is -typically -semiadditive and is compatible with -finite -space colimits (equivalently limits). Let denote the sub--category of -typically -semiadditive -categories and -typically -semiadditive functors.Prop: -Typical -Semiadditivity from Building Blocks
Let . (1) An -category is -typically -semiadditive if and only if is -ambidextrous for all (2) For , a -semiadditive functor is -typically -semiadditive if and only if it preserves -(co)limits for all . Proof.
(1) Since is an -finite -space for all , the only if direction is definitional. Conversely, let be an -finite -space. Since is -semiadditive, we are reduced to the case that is connected. Indeed, otherwise for connected -finite -spaces. Thenand can be given by and by iterating Kan extensions, so as is -semiadditive it suffices that the norm maps are equivalences.Now, since is connected, the Postnikov tower of can be refined to a tower of principal fibrationssuch that the fiber of each is of the form for some , since all connected -finite -spaces are -nilpotent.Since we can iterate Kan extensions, to show is -ambidextrous it suffices to show each is -ambidextrous, and since -ambidexterity is a fiber-wise condition, this follows from the fact that is -ambidextrous.(2) Analogously to (1), we can reduce to connected -finite -spaces, at which point we can take a tower of principal fibrations, so that commuting with -(co)limits follows from commuting with -(co)limits, which are equivalent to commuting with fiber-wise indexed (co)limits, i.e. -(co)limits.
For a -typical -semiadditive -category , the cardinalities for will play an important role in our definition of semiadditive height. The motivating example to consider in what follows is the following:-modules of -local Spectra
For , we have for all , where the case is interpreted using .
We now move to defining semiadditive height. This relies on the following notion of divisibility and completeness with respect to natural endomorphisms of the identity.Divisibility and Completeness
Let and let be a natural endomorphism. An object is called: -divisible if is invertible
-complete if for all -divisible We suggestively write for the full subcategories spanned by the -divisible and -complete objects, respectively.Semiadditive Height of Objects
Let be a -typical -semiadditive -category and let . We define the -typical semiadditive height of as follows for : (1) We say if is -divisible
(2) We say if is -complete
(3) We say if and . Warning
When is not -semiadditive, the notion of semiadditive height is not well-defined for all objects in . Indeed, we can only test an objects height being or if is to the semiadditivity of , so we can have objects which have height , and not have a finite defined height.
In particular, the statements and signify a certain property that satisfies, and is in general not a well-defined number which can be compared with .
For which is -semiadditive we write if and only if for all . By convention for all , and or if and only if .Height Let be a -semiadditive -category. Then an object is of height if and only if , the map obtained by is an equivalence, and of height if it is -complete.
The next result helps justify the inequality notation.Prop: Inequalities of Height
Let be a -typical -semiadditive -category and let be some integers. Then for (1) If then (2) If then Proof.
For (1) it suffices by iterating that if for some , then . Consider the principal fiber sequence<br>By assumption all maps and spaces in this sequence are -ambidextrous.

These notes primarily follow lectures by Rui Fernandes in the Spring of 2025 at UIUC.To begin we recall, and internalize, the classification of vector bundles via cocycles. Recall that for a topological space with an open cover and a topological group, a -valued cocycle is a family of continuous (smooth) maps such that for all and for all for all Note that given the first two conditions, the cocycle condition is equivalent to a functoriality condition, namely that . Two such cocycles on the same cover are said to be equivalent if we have a family of continuous (smooth) maps such thatMore generally we say two cocycles on are equivalent if there is some common refinement of their covers on which they are equivalent. Theorem: Principal Bundles via cocycles
For a topological space , there is a one-to-one correspondence between principal -bundles and -cocycles up to equivalence (i.e. elements of ).
Proof.
TBC *** In the special case of we get a correspondence between rank vector bundles, up to isomorphism, -cocycles, where the cocycles are used to define the vector bundle by
The cocycles for vector bundles transform in the following ways for standard constructions on vector bundles:
Tensor: has fibers and cocycle with values in Dual V.B: has fibers and cocycle Exterior Product: has fibers and cocycles with values in Hom: has fibers , and there is a natural isomorphism .
We begin by considering Riemannian metrics on vector bundles.Riemannian Metric
A (smooth) Riemannian metric on a (smooth) vector bundle is a continuous (resp. smooth) map such that defines an inner product on .
Equivalently, a Riemannian metric is a section of that is fiberwise positive definite.Metric on Tautological Bundle
If is the tautological line bundle on , then we have the natural metric inherited from that on , Note that the subset spanned by inner products on a vector space is a convex subset. In particular, if with , and , then . This allows us to use partitions of unity to construct Riemannian metrics.Existence of Riemannian Metrics
If is a vector bundle and is a paracompact Hausdorff space, then admits a Riemannain metric .
Note that we have a bijection between and the subspace of symmetric and positive definite matrices. Now, the map given by squaring, sending , is a diffeomorphism, with inverse . Because of this diffeomorphism we can compare any metric with the one coming from the standard metric on .Comparison of Metrics
If is a Riemannian metric on , there is a bundle isomorphism such that Proof.

If , then setting completes the proof. Otherwise, inductively suppose that the claim holds for some , and suppose is a collection of linearly independent sections on . Then by the inductive hypothesis we have linearly independent sections such that for all and and such that for all and .Now, recall that the space of continuous sections over has the structure of a -module, where is the ring of continuous real-valued functions on . Then in particular we can define

Note that as is linearly independent for all , and since for all by the inductive hypothesis, as defined is non-vanishing and in fact is linearly independent in . Now, by construction we have that for all where the second equality is by the inductive hypothesis. Additionally, for all and all we can use bilinearity of to computeusing our inductive hypothesis in the second equality. Thus, is a collection of linearly independent orthogonal sections satisfying the hypotheses of the claim, and hence by induction the proof of the lemma is complete. ***Splitting SES for Vector Bundles

As in this special case, connections on a vector bundle form an affine space modelled on the vector space of bundle morphisms . Indeed, if and are two connections, then corresponds to a -bilinear map , or equivalently a -linear map , which is the same as a bundle morphism . Additionally, under this correspondence, if is a connection and is some -bilinear map, so that it corresponds to a bundle morphism, the sum is again a connection.Alternatively, a bundle morphism can also be thought of as a smooth family of -linear maps , which is the same as a -form in . Thus, we can also think of the space of linear connections on as an affine space modelled on . Note that this implies that for any convex combination , so that , and any family of connections on , , the combination is again a connection on . Indeed, if then this just says that

We begin with a discussion on oriented bundles before surveying the Thom isomorphism, Euler classes, Thom spaces, and Stiefel-Whitney classes.Notation: Throughout we write for the Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum of a ring (or more generally abelian group) . If is a vector bundle, we write for the corresponding total space.To motivate our definition of an orientation for a vector bundle let's begin with a single vector space.Orientation on a vector space
Let be a real vector space of dimension . An orientation of is an equivalence class of bases, where two (ordered) bases and are equivalent if and only if their change of basis matrix has positive determinant.
Every vector space has two distinct orientations. We often equip with its canonical orientation given by the equivalence class containing the standard ordered basis . <br>Previously we've discussed orientations in the context of simplices when defining simplicial and singular homology in <a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology</a><a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology</a>. To see how these are related, let be an -simplex which is linearly embedded in the -dimensional vector space with ordered vertices . Then forms a basis on corresponding to an orientation of the vector space.We can interpret a choice of orientation for as a choice of one of the two possible generators for the singular homology groups
To see this let denote the standard -simplex with canonically ordered vertices. Choose some orientation preserving linear embedding which maps the barycenter of to the zero vector, and hence the boundary of into . Then is a singular -simplex representing an element in the group of relative -cycles . The homology class of this -cycle is now the preferred generator for the homology group .Similarly, using dual bases we obtain a preferred generator of the cohomology group . We could also use a LES argument as in the following:Relative Cohomology of For a ring , and dually for homology.

Thus, the statement follows from the LES of pairs. ***Note that explicitly the factor of comes in the LES from the associated SESThus, when , an orientation corresponds to choosing an orientation on either with an outward or inward normal.Let's now generalize to a vector bundle of fiber dimension , and give a first naive definition of orientation.Orientation on a Vector Bundle #1
An orientation for is a function assigning an orientation to each fiber of subject to the following local compatibility: For every , there exists a local trivialization with and such that for each fiber over , the homomorphism is orientation preserving. In terms of cohomology this says that to each fiber there is assigned a preferred generator
The local compatibility condition implies that for each point in the base space, there exists a neighborhood and a cohomology class
so that for each fiber over , the restriction
In particular, these glue to give a Thom class . Moving forward we will write for without the zero section.Alternatively, recall that if is a vector bundle over of rank , we have its exterior power which is a line bundle over . Then a compatible choice of orientations is equivalent to a compatible choice of non-zero elements in the fibers for . Thus, is orientable in the above sense if and only if admits a non-vanishing section, and hence is a trivial line bundle. In this case, any two non-vanishing sections are said to be equivalent if there exists , , such that ( can be chosen to be smooth if and are). This gives a second definition for orientations:Orientation on a Vector Bundle #2
An orientation for is an equivalence class of non-vanishing sections .
When , for a smooth manifold, this recovers the usual orientation of manifolds. <br>Using our <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Basics of Fiber Bundles and Principal Bundles > ^2c635f" data-href="Basics of Fiber Bundles and Principal Bundles#^2c635f" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/fibrations/basics-of-fiber-bundles-and-principal-bundles.html#^2c635f" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">cocycle classification of bundles</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Basics of Fiber Bundles and Principal Bundles > ^2c635f" data-href="Basics of Fiber Bundles and Principal Bundles#^2c635f" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/fibrations/basics-of-fiber-bundles-and-principal-bundles.html#^2c635f" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">cocycle classification of bundles</a>, a vector bundle being orientable can be equivalently phrased as asking for the existence of a cocycle taking values in . This is the first case of a more general pattern of lifting the cocycle group for a bundle to give it additional structure.Orientation via Cocycles
Let be a vector bundle of rank on a space admitting partitions of unity (e.g. paracompact Hausdorff). Then admits a non-vanishing section if and only if admits a description in terms of cocycles taking values in .
Proof.
First, suppose is orientable so we have a global non-vanishing section . Say that a local frame is positively oriented if for all , for . All local frames are either positively or negatively oriented, and multiplying by in one of the coordinates we can always replace a negatively oriented local frame by a positively oriented local frame. Then we obtain our desired cover by positive local trivializations.Conversely, if such local trivializations with cocycles exist, then we can define by taking a partition of unity and summing the induced orientations on the . *** Another example of this phenomena occurs with Riemannian metrics, where admits a Riemannian metric if and only if it admits a cocycle with values in the orthogonal group . Over paracompact spaces this always holds via a partition of unity argument. Alternatively, it can be shown that , the polar decomposition, where are the positive definite symmetric matrices contractible?.Warning
A vector bundle over a manifold can be orientable without or being orientable.
2-3 property for orientability
Let be a rank vector bundle over . Then if two of are orientable, then so is the third.
Proof.<br>
Step 1: Suppose is a short exact sequence of vector bundles over with constant rank maps, where , , and . We start by proving that the 2-of-3 property holds for short exact sequences. From our construction of local trivializations in <a data-href="Operations on Vector Bundles#^7ff753" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/k-theory/vector-bundles/operations-on-vector-bundles.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Operations on Vector Bundles &gt; ^7ff753</a><a data-href="Operations on Vector Bundles#^7ff753" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/k-theory/vector-bundles/operations-on-vector-bundles.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Operations on Vector Bundles &gt; ^7ff753</a> we can find a cover of with trivialization on that extends to a trivialization of , such that gives trivializations for , so that if are the cocycles for and are the cocycles for , then are cocycles for . Then the result follows since .Step 2: Consider the zero section .

The forward implication is clear since , so it suffices to assume is orientable. However, this will follow from the homotopy invariance of pullbacks of vector bundles, proved below, and the fact that deformation retracts onto under the zero section, so that we have a pullback composite diagram<br><img src="images/svg-cache/dd95a7ec283504cb024350934d473c10.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;"> *** ToDo: Show how this notion of orientation is equivalent to the cohomology one

If , the induced -linear map is orientation preserving.
Proof.
Let be the -linear map sending to and to , and let with given by . Let be a representation of as a product of elementary matrices in . Since
it suffices to show that for each elementary matrix , is orientation preserving. We proceed in cases:
(i) Suppose first that corresponds to multiplying the th row of by . Then we have that for , if ,
$$
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E\mathbb{R} e{2k-1} = \varphi(Ee{k}) = \varphi(e_k) = e{2k-1},;;\text{ and };;E\mathbb{R} e{2k} = \varphi(E(iek)) = \varphi(ie_k) = e{2k}&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E\mathbb{R} e{2j-1} = \varphi(Ee{j}) = \varphi((a+ib)e_j) = ae{2j-1}+be_{2j}

$$
Thus, $E\mathbb{R}$ acts on the wedge product byand so since $a+ib \in \mathbb{C}^\times$, $(a^2+b^2) &gt; 0$. Thus, $E_\mathbb{R}$ is orientation preserving, as desired. (ii) Next, suppose corresponds to sending to for some , . Then we have that for , if ,
$$
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E\mathbb{R} e{2k-1} = \varphi(Ee{k}) = \varphi(e_k) = e{2k-1},;;\text{ and };;E\mathbb{R} e{2k} = \varphi(E(iek)) = \varphi(ie_k) = e{2k}

Then $E\mathbb{R}$ acts on the wedge for the standard basis and orientation on by

$ or will involve a repeated entry yielding a zero wedge product since . Therefore, is orientation preserving once again.

Therefore, is orientation preserving when is a transposition of rows.It follows that for any elementary matrix , is orientation preserving, and so , being a product of orientation preserving linear maps, is also orientation preserving, as desired. ***Complex Vector Bundles are -orientable
If is a complex vector bundle, the underlying real vector bundle has a canonical -orientation.
Proof.
Let be a complex vector bundle of rank with paracompact Hausdorff base , so that admits a Riemannian metric. Let be the associated real bundle of rank , where as underlying spaces . Let be an open cover of with trivializations . Then we obtained associated trivializations for given by . Note that both maps in the composite are homeomorphisms and -linear isomorphisms on fibers, so the indeed provide local trivializations for .For let
be the transition function for the complex bundle , where for and . Then the induced transition functions for the real bundle with at are given by matrices which act on by
Therefore, denoting the transition functions by for , it follows by our first part that for every , is orientation preserving, and so lands in .Now, as the base is paracompact Hausdorff, admits a Riemannian metric . From lecture we have for each a continuous map , where is the space of symmetric positive definite matrices, such that for all and ,
Hence, if we define by for each , then we can obtain new local trivializations . Then the transition functions associated with these trivializations are given by . By construction we have that for any and ,Therefore, for all . Additionally, for all and ,
has positive determinant since positive definite matrices have positive determinants and lands in . Therefore, we have that for &nbsp;all , which are the transition functions for the local trivializations of , and so from lecture it follows that is -orientable, as desired. Further, this -orientation is canonically induced as in the first part as follows: for any , if is a complex basis for the fiber , then gives a real basis for the fiber, and further any complex basis determines a real basis on in the same equivalence class. Indeed, any two complex bases for can be interchanged by multiplication with an element in , which by the first part always corresponds to an orientation preserving matrix in , and so this construction gives a canonical orientation on the real vector bundle over . ***<br>Complex line bundles vs Oriented 2-Plane Bundles

Proof.
Let be a paracompact Hausdorff space. From Problem (1) we have an assignment sending a complex line bundle over to a real -plane bundle , where as spaces with the fibers viewed as real vector spaces under the isomorphism , and where as in the proof of Problem (1), the transition functions for are given by those for after conjugating by the -linear isomorphism . If we have a map of complex line bundles over ,<br><img src="images/svg-cache/6213a513e97d0c76362382f4b9ec5bcb.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">then the associated map given exactly by is a map of real vector bundles since -linear maps are in particular -linear. In particular, this shows that if is an isomorphism of complex vector bundles, will be an isomorphism of real vector bundles since this assignment is functorial, so our assignment from problem (1) induces a map
where on both sides , for , is the equivalence relation for isomorphisms of -linear vector bundles over .It remains to show that this assignment is bijective. For surjectivity let be an oriented -plane bundle over . Since is paracompact Hausdorff we have that admits a Riemannian metric . Then, as is -oriented there exists a cover of with local trivializations that send the orientation on the fibers of to the standard orientation on , and such that for every , the transition function is valued in the special orthogonal group. Post composing the transition functions by for each we obtain local trivializations which induce the structure of a one dimensional complex vector space on each fiber of . It remains to show that these structures are compatible, which is to say the corresponding transition maps are isomorphisms of -vector spaces on each fiber.Let and consider the transition function . Fix . Since we can write it in the form
for some , where . Then for any , we have thatThus, is the -linear isomorphism given by multiplication by . Therefore, with these local trivializations and transition functions, becomes a complex line bundle . Further, the forward map takes this complex line bundle to the real -plane bundle with underlying space admitting local trivializations
Thus, the resulting vector space structure on the fibers of and its structure as a real -plane bundle coincide with its original structures, implying that is in the image of the map.Finally, for injectivity it suffices to show that the above construction is independent of the choice of metric. Indeed, for any complex line bundle , since is paracompact we can construct a sesquilinear forms on the original complex line bundle. Thus, as in lecture, we have an open cover of together with local trivializations that preserve this form, so that their transition functions are valued in . Let be the associated local trivializations for the real -plane bundle, as defined in problem 1, which by construction preserve orientations. Note that conjugating by induces an isomorphism , and so the transition functions for the are valued in . Then, the previous construction applied to these transition functions yields the complex vector bundle again exactly, since we obtain the original local trivializations back. Hence, if we have independence for choices of metrics we will obtain that any other reconstruction of a complex line bundle from the associated real -plane bundle will produce isomorphic complex line bundles.Now, to show independence suppose is an oriented -plane bundle and and are two Riemannian metrics on . Then as suggested in Milnor and Stasheff~\cite{milnor}, we can use the square root map on positive definite operators on the composite bundle isomorphism where is the map . To construct this we apply the positive definite square root operator locally on trivializations. Note that after possibly taking intersections of covers, we have an open cover together with local trivializations and which preserve orientations and the metrics and , respectively. Then for each , the composite is determined by a continuous map , where is the set of symmetric positive definite operators, since on each fiber the composite is represented by the multiplication of the matrices associated to and for their respective local trivializations, which are symmetric positive definite operators since the and are metric preserving for and , respectively. Composing with the square root operator from lecture we obtain continuous maps which agree on overlaps since the and preserve their respective Riemannian metrics. Hence, these maps determine an -linear isomorphism , which by construction satisfies . Now, as in the above construction, and Then observe that for each and , observe thatThus, the induced transition matrix lands in the orthogonal group, and in fact since all maps involved are orientation preserving, it lands in . Thus, as in the previous construction using the fact that conjugation by induces an isomorphism , it follows that for the constructed complex bundles and , is a homeomorphism which is an isomorphism of complex vector spaces on each fiber. Thus, the construction produces isomorphic complex line bundles for different metrics, and so we obtain it is well-defined and hence from our work in the previous paragraph, the mapping is also injective. Therefore we obtain a bijection
as desired. ***It turns out that is also universal for orientability, much as is, as we will now show through a sequence of lemmas:-orientability gives If is a -orientable vector bundle, then .
Proof.
Let be a -orientable vector bundle of rank over a compact base . Let denote the quotient map, and let denote the induced map on cohomology, where is the subspace obtained by removing the zero section. Then for every , we have a commuting diagram

where squares (1)-(4) commute by naturality of , and square (5) commutes by considering the reduced cellular cochain complex for the sphere . Additionally, The vertical isomorphisms in square (3) come from the long exact sequence of the pair , while the isomorphisms in (4) follow from the deformation retract sending a vector to . It follows that the map on cohomology of fibers, , corresponds exactly to the quotient map for all .Since sends to , it follows that any -orientation is mapped to a orientation . Further, since is a ring homomorphism and is natural, we have a commuting square
\begin{tikzcd}&nbsp; &nbsp; {H^n(E,E^#;\Z)} &amp;&amp; {H^n(E,E^#;\Z/4)} \&nbsp; &nbsp; \&nbsp; &nbsp; {H^0(B;\Z)} &amp;&amp; {H^0(B;\Z/4)}&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["{\varphi_*}", from=1-1, to=1-3]&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["{\Phi_U}", "\cong"', from=3-1, to=1-1]&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["{\varphi_*}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["{\Phi{\varphi*(U)}}"', "\cong", from=3-3, to=1-3]\end{tikzcd}
for any fixed -orientation of , where the vertical maps are the Thom isomorphisms for the orientations and . From lecture this square restricts to a commuting diagram on units and orientations:
\begin{tikzcd}&nbsp; &nbsp; {\mathcal{O}(E;\Z)} &amp;&amp; {\mathcal{O}(E;\Z/4)} \&nbsp; &nbsp; \&nbsp; &nbsp; {H^0(B;\Z)^\times} &amp;&amp; {H^0(B;\Z/4)^\times} \&nbsp; &nbsp; \&nbsp; &nbsp; {(\Z^\times)^{|\pi_0(B)|}} &amp;&amp; {((\Z/4)^\times)^{|\pi_0(B)|}}&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["{\varphi_*}", from=1-1, to=1-3]&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["{\Phi_U}", "\cong"', from=3-1, to=1-1]&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["{\varphi_*}"', from=3-1, to=3-3]&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["{\Phi{\varphi*(U)}}"', "\cong", from=3-3, to=1-3]&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["\cong", from=5-1, to=3-1]&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["{\varphi_*}"', from=5-1, to=5-3]&nbsp; &nbsp; \arrow["\cong"', from=5-3, to=3-3]\end{tikzcd}
where in the bottom square we used the isomorphism for any ring , where under this isomorphism the copy of in associated to a path component is generated by the cocycle that sends all points in to , and all points in other path components to zero. But and , so the bottom map, being induced by the &nbsp;quotient , is in fact an isomorphism. Therefore, since all the vertical maps are isomorphisms, it follows that the other two instances of must be isomorphisms as well. In other words, induces a bijectionas desired. ***Gluing up -orientability from -Orientability

These notes are primarily adapted from Rui's Math 519 course notes in Spring 2025 at UIUC, with additional perspectives from Jake Rasmussen's Math 526 in Fall 2024.To begin we'll start with the theory of fiber bundles and locally trivial fibrations. Throughout let denote the ambient category of topological objects (e.g. topological spaces, compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces, possibly infinite dimensional smooth manifolds, etc.).Locally Trivial Fibration
A locally trivial fibration with fiber type is a map such that for every , there exists an open neighborhood of of and an isomorphism in .
Note that if is a trivializing cover for a fiber bundle with fiber type , then the transition function determines a cocycle (which is a map in if it is a cartesian closed category, which we assume moving forward).If in addition is a group object such that we have an effective group action (i.e. the induced map is a monomorphism), then we can add the requirement that the cocycle takes values in the image of . This leads to the notion of fiber bundle.Fiber Bundle
A fiber bundle with fiber and structure group consists of a locally trivial fibration with fiber type , an effective left -action , and a collection of locally trivializing charts such that There exists in , such that The collection is maximal in the sense that if is a trivializing chart such that there exists with , then . When is a vector space and , this definition recovers the notion of a vector bundle. When , with the free transitive action by left translation, this definition encodes the notion of a -principal bundle. A morphism of -fiber bundles is a map in such that for all , the induced map given by pulling back along fibers is a map of -spaces. In particular, if and are trivializations for and , with , then being -equivariant implies that for each , the induced map must satisfy , so that we get an induced map such that .Now, we say that -cocycles and for covers of are equivalent if there exists a common refinement for the open covers together with maps such that for all ,
If denotes the set of equivalence classes of -cocycles, then we have a one-to-one correspondence
between elements of and isomorphism classes of -fiber bundles over with fiber fixed. Explicitly, given a -cocycle for a cover of , the associated -fiber bundle is
Construction: Reduction of Structure Group
Given a closed subgroup , we say that the structure group of a -fiber bundle can be reduced to if there exists a cocycle for with values in .
Reduction Examples A -fiber bundle is trivial (i.e. isomorphic to ) if and only if the structure group can be reduced to .
For a vector bundle, the structure group can be reduced to if and only if it is orientable if and only if it admits a metric if and only if it is orientable and admits a metric Notice that the cocycle description does not reference the fiber . As a consequence of the previous correspondence, we then have the following:
To every -fiber bundle with fiber , there is associated a -principal bundle (defined up to isomorphism)
Alternatively, to every -principal bundle, , if is a space with effective -action , we have an associated -fiber bundle with fiber . Further, and is a -cocycle associated to the -principal bundle , so that , thenso that corresponds to the same cocycle as .Theorem: Fiber Bundles Via Principal Bundles Via Cocycles
Let be agroup, let be a space with an effective -action, and let . Then the composite of bijections
can be given explicitly by sending a -principal bundle to the -fiber bundle .
This perspective plays an essential role due to the simplicity with which -Principal bundles can be described, and the number of classifying space results associated with them.First, let's recall some constructions of -principal bundles when is or .Theorem: Slice Theorem
Let be a proper action. For each there exists an embedded submanifold containing and satisfying is -invariant
, where is the orbit at in For and such that , . Proof.
TBL *** Theorem: Smooth Structure on Quotient
If is a free and proper action, then the quotient space has a unique (smooth) structure such that the quotient map is a submersion.
Proof.
TBL *** Theorem: Quotient Principal Bundle
Let be a free and proper right action. Then is a -principal bundle. Further, every -principal bundle is of this form.
Proof.
TBL *** Thus, we can identify -principal bundles with free and proper right actions , so that for any left action , we get another free and proper action , where , so that quotienting by this action gives the associated bundle .Associated Bundles The trivial -principal bundle is , with associated bundle for any action the trivial -bundle .
Homogeneous spaces: For a closed subgroup, is a principal -bundle
Covering Spaces: A universal covering is a principal -bundle . More generally, if is a normal subgroup, is a covering space with group of deck transformations , which is a principal -bundle.
Frame Bundle For any vector bundle with fiber a vector space , it's associated frame bundle is the principal -bundle The associated bundle is . If instead one uses the induced actions or , then we get and Note that if is a principal -bundle and is a space with an effective -action, then a section of is equivalent to a map such that . In other words, . More generally, if is an open subset, written as for open, then .Note: In general, a -fiber bundle does not need to have any sections. In particular, a -principal bundle has a section if and only if we have a -equivariant map in the sense that .In the case where is a -fiber bundle with -contractible, we always have sections, and any two sections are homotopic. Indeed, if is -contractible, so that we have a -equivariant homotopy for , where is necessarily a -fixed point, then gives a -equivariant map, and hence a section, while any other -equivariant map is -homotopic to this one, and hence induces homotopic sections.-Structure for a Manifold
Given a closed subgroup and a (smooth) manifold , a reduction of is called a -structure. The reduction is called integrable if it locally has sections consisting of commuting vector fields (equivalently if has local charts with induced local frames determining local sections of the reduced -Principal bundle ).
Now, note that the pullback of -fiber bundles with structure group are again -fiber bundles with structure group . In particular, if is a principal -bundle, then for , so is , and for an effective -space , . Further, homotopic maps induce isomorphic principal -bundles, and hence isomorphic -fiber bundles with structure group .Trivial Bundles over Products with Intervals

Before exploring this generalization let's consider some simple computations involving vector bundles over spheres.Whitney Sum of Mobius Bundle Trivializes

Let be the mobius bundle over , where for all . By definition the Whitney Sum is the vector bundle over given by the pullback of the product bundle along the diagonal:<br><img src="images/svg-cache/07fa40447d7134814ef0fd93fc914f93.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">If denotes an element in as an equivalence class, then as a space is isomorphic to the subspace of .

Therefore, define a global frame for the vector bundle, and hence is a trivial bundle, as desired. Trivializing Tangent Bundle for The tangent bundle is trivial.
Proof.
To show that is a trivial vector bundle over it suffices to construct a global frame. For this, first note that can be identified with the unit sphere in . Further, as smooth manifold , the group of quarternions, where is identified with . Further, the quarternions are equipped with multiplication given on byAdditionally, has a natural norm given for by , where . Note that we can computeso under the isomorphism the norm on coincides with the Euclidean norm on . In particular, this shows that under this isomorphism can be identified with the unit sphere in . Further, since all components are polynomials in the input coordinates the map given by is smooth, where is given a smooth structure under the identifications . Further, in coordinates has differential at given by the row matrix<br>

Proof.<br>
Let . Recall that the natural action of on restricts to an action on since orthogonal matrices preserve the lengths of vectors. Since this is an action by diffeomorphisms, applying the tangent bundle functor to these maps gives an action of on . Realizing under Proposition 5.38 of Lee<a data-footref="2" href="#fn-2-d829fed119f143be" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2-3]</a> and using the canonical smooth bundle isomorphism , we have that&nbsp; &nbsp; where above denotes the Euclidean dot product. Under this identification, if , then the associated diffeomorphism given by matrix multiplication has total differential given by<br>
This follows from the fact that this formula holds for the differential of the un-restricted linear map by Proposition 3.13 of Lee<a data-footref="2" href="#fn-2-d829fed119f143be" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2-4]</a>, as well as the fact that we have a commuting diagram of differentials<br><img src="images/svg-cache/fe889e486a70bde2944f304e622d98ff.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">Note that since the action given by taking differentials is smooth, since it is smooth in each component, being matrix multiplication, the restricted action to the embedded submanifold is also smooth.&nbsp;
Now, we can define a smooth map by composing the inclusion with the action map , where for the first two standard basis vectors. Note that explicitly , where and are unit vectors since preserves lengths, being an orthogonal matrix. It follows that because the image of this map lands in the sphere bundle , which is a properly embedded submanifold of , we can regard it as a smooth map . Since is compact to show that is a homeomorphism it suffices to show that it is bijective. First, suppose such that . Then in particular we have that and . Since and are normalized and orthogonal to the plane spanned by , we must have that . But, , and having a column with a different sign would cause the determinant to change sign. Thus, we must have , and so in particular , implying that is injective.To show surjectivity let . Since and are normalized and orthogonal we can complete the set to an orthonormal basis of . Setting to be the matrix with columns , , and , respectively, it follows that . In particular, since . If then we can replace with in the last column to obtain a matrix with determinant . Thus, after this possible change we can ensure that with first two columns and , respectively. Thus,
and so is surjective. Being a bijective continuous map out of a compact space it follows that is our desired homeomorphism, completing the proof. ***
This computation allows us to identify with :Homeomorphism between and There exists a homeomorphism .
Proof.
First, we recall that elements of correspond to rotations in . For , letdenote the matrix given by angle about the -axis. Note that since the components of are continuous functions of , this assignment defines a continuous map . Now, let . Then we can write for some . From calculus we can complete these vector to an orthonormal basis on by setting , , and . In particular, the matrix with columns , in that order, is an orthogonal matrix, and since and , is also orientation preserving, and so , implying that .Note that as defined above are continuous functions of and , so in particular the assignment sending to where as above is a continuous map. Further, since spherical coordinates provide local coordinate charts on the sphere, the map defined as above by sending to is locally given up to homeomorphism by the stated continuous map on . Therefore, since continuity is a local property is itself continuous.Now, we can define a map for and by
which is exactly a rotation about by an angle since sends to , which fixes, while sending the orthogonal plane spanned by and to the plane spanned by and , which rotates. Since matrix multiplication is continuous and since and have been shown to be continuous above, is also continuous.We can now define a map by if and otherwise. Note that since is continuous in each variable, is continuous, so to show is continuous it suffices to show that if is a sequence of non-zero vectors converging to , so as , then as . However, note that
so as is continuous, as we have that converges to . Now, observe that
Using the operator norm we see that
which converges to as , where we used the fact that elements of have operator norm since they preserve length. Thus, converges to as goes to , and in particular is continuous, as desired.Now, if then is rotation about some vector by an angle , implying that . If then , and hence is in the image of . If we can set , in which case
since . Otherwise, if then note that since rotating clockwise about by is the same as rotating counter-clockwise by , where since . Hence, in this case we obtain where now . Thus, is surjective.Next, suppose such that , so . Since is a proper angle we must have that . If , then as they must agree, and hence , implying . Otherwise, if , we can use that fact that
to reduce to the first case, obtaining that , or . But as , this is only possible when . Therefore, we have that if and only if or and . By the universal property of the quotient and the homeomorphism mentioned in the question, we have a unique continuous and injective map making the diagram<br><img src="images/svg-cache/436baad9bfd0357d2a1d6cf80447b064.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">commute. But is surjective, so as the quotient map is surjective it follows that is a bijection. Thus, since is compact, being the continuous image of the compact ball , it follows that is a homeomorphism, and hence , as desired. ***Non-Vanishing Sections for If has nonvanishing section , then the antipodal map is homotopic to . In particular, does not have a nonvanishing section. However, we can give an explicit formula for a nonvanishing section of .
Proof.
Antipodal Map: &nbsp; &nbsp; Let be an integer. First, suppose is a non-vanishing section. Note that, as in problem 4, for each , can be identified with the following subspace of :<br>where is the Euclidean dot product (c.f.

Since is non-vanishing, composing smooth maps we obtain the smooth map given by , so for all .&nbsp; &nbsp; Now, define a map by . Since for all , we have thatusing the fact that , so is well-defined and continuous as a map from to . Further, for all , and . Therefore, and the anti-podal map are homotopic, viewed as maps from to itself, as desired.<br>Non-vanishing section for : Let be an integer. Then from property (f) for degrees from Hatcher<a data-footref="3" href="#fn-3-d829fed119f143be" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a> we have that has degree . However, has degree , so as degree is a homotopy invariant the first part of the problem implies that has no non-vanishing global section.On the other hand, does admit a non-vanishing global section which can be given on by
Since all the components of this map are smooth, it will also be smooth as long as it is well-defined, so we must show that for all under our identifications in the first part of the problem. For this observe that
and thus , as desired. Further, since for any , , it follows that , so is a global non-vanishing section of , as desired. ***Clutching Construction
Consider the sphere as the union of its two hemispheres, and , intersecting in the equator . Now given a vector bundle , and a representation of the product vector bundle , we can construct an -dimensional bundle by letting by the quotient Given homotopic clutching maps , the resulting bundles and are isomorphic. In fact, we can apply the clutching construction to a homotopy to get a vector bundle which restricts to and on and , respectively.Classifying Bundles over the Sphere

Since the homology of consists of free abelian groups, the universal coefficient theorem implies we have a natural isomorphism , so that the dual map sends a generator to .Let be the tautological complex line bundle over . From problem 1 we have that under the identification , gives a real -plane bundle over that comes equipped a canonical -orientation . To determine we use the Gysin sequence for the bundle, noting that from lecture. Thus, the non-trivial part of the Gysin sequence takes the form<br><img src="images/svg-cache/dfaa8bb1f8045d1777bded0a90b3aaf0.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">where we've used the homeomorphism throughout and the fact that cohomology in negative degrees is . Since , it follows that
is an isomorphism by exactness. This is only possible if is a generator. In other words, we have that is a generator of , and since we're taking the canonical orientation we can choose our generator such that .Now, for any , there exists such that by the above work. Then consider the pullback line bundle<br><img src="images/svg-cache/d3694295765212a6d10c9471eb97dfd5.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">for the map described in the first paragraph. By naturality of the Euler class it follows that
so is our desired complex line bundle.Finally, it remains to compute for , which we will do using the Gysin sequence.

A real vector bundle of rank over is a topological space together with a surjective continuous map satisfying the following conditions: For each , the fiber over is endowed with the structure of a -dimensional vector space.
For each , there exists a neighborhood of in and a homeomorphism , called a local trivialization of over , satisfying (i.e. is a bundle map over )
For each , the restriction is an isomorphism of vector spaces. The space is called the total space of the bundle, is called its base, and is its projection.
<br>Note that a real vector bundle is precisely a locally trivial fibration (c.f. <a data-href="Basics of Fiber Bundles and Principal Bundles" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/fibrations/basics-of-fiber-bundles-and-principal-bundles.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Basics of Fiber Bundles and Principal Bundles</a><a data-href="Basics of Fiber Bundles and Principal Bundles" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/fibrations/basics-of-fiber-bundles-and-principal-bundles.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Basics of Fiber Bundles and Principal Bundles</a>) with fiber , and with a choice of atlas such that the transition functions are linear isomorphisms on the fibers.If and are smooth manifolds with or without boundary, is a smooth map, and the local trivializations can be chosen to be diffeomorphisms, then is called a smooth vector bundle and any local trivialization that is a diffeomorphism is called a smooth local trivialization.We usually refer to rank-1 vector bundles as (real) line bundles. If we replace with above, and require all vector spaces to be -vector spaces, we obtain the notion of a complex vector bundle. In this note we will restrict to considering real vector bundles.Smooth Vector Bundle Maps are Submersions
Suppose is a smooth vector bundle. Then is a surjective smooth submersion.
Proof.
For , we can take a smooth local trivializations . Then we have that for all ,
by the chain rule. Since is a smooth submersion, being a projection, and is a diffeomorphism, it follows that is surjective, and in particular is a smooth submersion. *** If there exists a global trivialization of a vector bundle , we will say that is a trivial bundle. If is a smooth bundle admitting a smooth global trivialization, we say that the bundle is smoothly trivial. For the remainder of the note we will primary be restricting to smooth bundles and smooth trivializations.Product Bundle
If , then , the projection, is naturally a rank -real vector bundle called the product bundle, and by construction is trivial. If is a smooth manifold with or without boundary, then is smoothly trivial.
Mobius Bundle
Define an equivalence relation on by if and only if for some integer . Then has a projection map , the sphere, using the isomorphism .
If is the quotient map, if , then is still a quotient map, so we can think of as the space obtained from the strip given by taking a half-twist of the right-hand side and pasting the result with the left-hand side. For any , the image under of the rectangle is a smooth compact manifold with boundary referred to as a Mobius band.
It turns out we can endow with a unique smooth structure such that is a smooth covering map and is a smooth real line bundle over , called the Mobius bundle. In particular, the local trivializations of can be interpreted as coordinate charts for the smooth structure on .
Tautological Bundle
The tautological line bundle is defined by with component-wise addition and scalar multiplication. Similarly, we have the tautological complex line bundle defined by In either case the trivializing neighborhoods are given by , for , with trivialization so that the transition functions are given by which gives the cocycle formula . Note that these are smooth (resp. holomorphic), so the tautological line bundles are smooth (resp. holomorphic) vector bundles.
As mentioned at the start, the vector bundles of primary interest for us are the tangent bundles of smooth manifolds.The Tangent Bundle as a Vector Bundle
Let be a smooth -manifold with or without boundary. Then is a smooth vector bundle of rank over .
Proof.
Let be a smooth chart for . Then we have the associated smooth chart on , given by
Composing with then gives our desired smooth local trivialization, and further since each are linear maps, restricts to linear maps on fibers. *** Note that from the above construction the transition functions for are given by for a given atlas on .Spheres
Note that through the canonical embedding we can realized as the bundle with total space Then give the localizing neighborhoods for the trivializations where projects away the th coordinate.
We now begin describing transition functions between smooth local trivializations.Transition Maps for Smooth Trivializations
Let be a smooth vector bundle of rank over . Suppose and are smooth local trivializations with . Then there exists a smooth map such that the composite is given by Proof.

Let be a smooth manifold with or without boundary and suppose for each we have a real vector bundle of some fixed dimension . Let and let be the natural projection. Suppose that we are given the following data: An open cover of for each , a bijection whose restriction to each is a vector space isomorphism for each with , a smooth map such that for all Then has a unique topology and smooth structure making it into a smooth manifold with or without boundary and a smooth rank- vector bundle over with as projection and as smooth local trivializations.
Proof.
The first part of the claim follows from the associated smooth chart lemma for manifolds, and by construction the coordinate charts are local trivializations of the resulting vector bundle. *** Whitney Sums
Given smooth vector bundles and of ranks and , respectively. We can define their Whitney sum to be , with the natural projection .
For , choose a neighborhood of small enough that we have local trivializations and for the two bundles. Then we have given by
If and are the transition functions for the two bundles, then by construction the transition function for their Whitney sum is given by the direct sum , which is smooth as each component is smooth.
We can also give an alternate description of the Whitney sum using pullbacks of vector bundles.Pulling back smooth bundles
Let be a smooth vector bundle of rank and let be a smooth map. Then the pullback of the co-span in exists and is a rank vector bundle over , with the pullback square being a morphism of vector bundles.

By construction these are linear isomorphisms on the fibers since is. *** We can then define the Whitney sum of to be the pullback along the diagonal of the product bundle,
Restriction of a Vector Bundle
Suppose is a rank- vector bundle and is any subset. We define the restriction of to to be with induced projection and trivializations. Formally, we can realize as the pullback of along the inclusion .
Given a smooth manifold and a submanifold , we refer to the restricted bundle as the ambient tangent bundle over .
Let be a vector bundle throughout. Recall a section of is a section in the category (or whatever category the bundle lives in) which is simply a map such that (i.e. it is a lift of the identity along ). A local section of is a lift of an open inclusion . We will refer to such a section as rough if it is only a section on the level of set functions (i.e. not necessarily smooth or even continuous).The support of a section is defined as the closure of the set .Zero Section
If is a vector bundle, the zero section is continuous, and is smooth if is smooth. To show this it suffices to check locally so let , with be a local trivialization. Then is the inclusion , which is continuous (and smooth in the smooth case).
Sections
Suppose is a smooth manifold with or without boundary: Sections of are vector fields on Given an immersed submanifold with or without boundary, a section of the ambient tangent bundle is called a vector field along . It is a continuous map such that for each . When is tangent to at every point, this is exactly a vector field on .
If is the trivial bundle, there is a correspondence between sections of and continuous functions from to , where is sent to , while is sent to .
The correspondence in (3) yields an isomorphism As hinted in example (4), for a smooth vector bundle, the set of all smooth global sections of is a vector space under pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. These operations are smooth since they are smooth on the level of local trivializations.Sheaf of Sections of a Vector Bundle
Let be a smooth vector bundle. Then is a sheaf of -modules.
Proof.
From the above work we have that for any open , the space of -local sections is a real vector space. Further, if and , then we can define by pointwise multiplication, so
Again this is smooth since scalar multiplication is smooth after looking at local trivializations. Further, since this operation is defined pointwise it satisfies the axioms of a module inherited from the vector space axioms for the fiber. Further, restriction is restriction of functions, and so naturally commutes with this pointwise module structure.<br>It remains to show that satisfies the sheaf condition.

Local Frame Associated with Local Trivializations
Suppose is a smooth vector bundle. If is a smooth local trivialization of , we can construct a local frame for over given any basis of by composing the from the last example with the local trivialization .
In the last example we used a general phenomenon that we can push-forward smooth sections of vector bundles along bundle homomorphisms.Local Frames Local Trivializations

for a closed -manifold , there exists an infinite cyclic local coefficient system on and a class such that the cap product with induces, for every local coefficient system on , the isomorphisms Alternatively we can formulate the statement in terms of local systems of spectra. Let be the unique map to a point, where we view as a space, forgetting its geometric structure. Then we get adjunctions<br><img src="images/svg-cache/84ba51099b1eb1d60a5ad7bd734911a8.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">For a local system , we view (resp. ) as the homology (resp. cohomology) of with coefficients in the local system . This becomes precise once we take homotopy groups if is a constant local system at a spectrum. For example, the Spivak normal fibration of a smooth manifold allows us to construct a -invertible local system . The stable Pointryagin-Thom collapse map then can be viewed as a map , which from our perspective that represents represents the fundamental class for . We will describe later how we can form a cap product with the fundamental class as a morphism in :and Poincare duality can be interpreted as the requirement that this transformation is an equivalence. This can be seen to be a reformulation of twisted ambidexterity, where is the dualizing sheaf of . More generally, this can be done for any compact space . We say a space is a Poincare space if it has a dualizing sheaf that takes values in invertible spectra . Consequently, all closed manifolds are Poincare spaces.Before defining the general theory let's motivate through classical Poincare duality.Classical Poincare Duality
For a closed smooth manifold , an embedding gives rise to a collapse map where is the normal bundle of the embedding. The stable homotopy type of this map doesn't depend on the choice of embedding, so we obtain a well-defined class , where the isomorphism is the Thom isomorphism and denotes the orientation local system for . Classical Poincare duality says that is an isomorphism.
This motivates the definition of Spivak data. Throughout we fix an -topos which we work internal to. For an object , we write for the associated map to the terminal object.Spivak Datum
Let and a symmetric monoidal -category which admits -shaped colimits. A -Spivak datum for consists of (i) an object , called the dualizing sheaf;
(ii) a map in called the fundamental class (or collapse map). Capping Map
Let be a symmetric monoidal -category which admits -shaped limits and colimits and satisfies the -projection formula (i.e. the Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence for all ). For each -Spivak datum on we can construct a natural transformation which is a morphism in .
Fundamental Class from a Capping Map
Given a natural transformation , and writing for the adjunction unit, we obtain a collapse map as the composite where in the last equivalence we are using the projection formula.
Collapse map for Capping Map
There is an equivalence .

Module Pushforwards from Multiplicative Basechanges
Suppose we have: Symmetric monoidal -categories , ,
A symmetric monoidal parameterized colimit-preserving functor as well as a -linear functor using the -linear structure on coming from ,
A map in and admit left Kan extensions along . Then for a -Spivak datum for , we define as the associated -Spivak datum for . The data also gives symmetric monoidal functors and , from which we can upgrade the functors , to - and a -linear one, respectively.
The main examples of this structure that will be important is:
(i) When and the -linear structure is given by the symmetric monoidality structure (ii) When , , and for some fixed object , so that the -linear structure on is the tautological one given by coming from the symmetric monoidal structure on .
Throughout let be a symmetric monoidal -category which admits -shaped limits and colimits and satisfies the -projection formula (for example this holds when is a presentably symmetric monoidal -category).Twisted Ambidexterity
A -Spivak datum on is twisted ambidextrous if the capping transformation is an equivalence.

In the case that is presentably symmetric monoidal, we say that the object itself is -Poincare if it is twisted -ambidextrous and the unique twisted ambidextrous Spivak datum is Poincare.Again we can also define the relative version:Poincare Duality Maps
Consider a map in and a symmetric monoidal -category such that the -category admits -shaped limits and colimits and satisfies the -projection formula. We say that a -Spivak datum for exhibits as a -Poincare duality map if it exhibits as a -Poincare duality object.
Poincare Duality from Higher Semiadditivity (1) For any topos and any symmetric monoidal -category , the terminal object has the tautological Poincare -Spivak datum .
(2) If is pointed, then the map in is -Poincare
(3) If is semiadditive, then any finite fold map is -Poincare
<br>(4) More generally, Poincare spaces with trivial dualizing sheaf come from the theory of higher semiadditivity (c.f. <a data-href="Introduction to Semiadditivity" href="board-talks/ambidexterity-seminar/introduction-to-semiadditivity.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Introduction to Semiadditivity</a><a data-href="Introduction to Semiadditivity" href="board-talks/ambidexterity-seminar/introduction-to-semiadditivity.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Introduction to Semiadditivity</a> and<a data-footref="3" href="#fn-3-9935e8a4b489814a" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a>) One of the important applications of the Spivak datum perspective is that it allows us to define a notion of degree for maps between Poincare spaces, which becomes an important computational invariant.Motivation: Classical Degree
Recall that given a map between closed connected manifolds of the same dimension, we can assign to it a degree if is compatible with the orientation behaviour of and . Namely, given an identification of orientation local systems, the degree is given by the image of under .
In order to generalize this to our current setting we'll need versions of (co)homological functoriality:(Co)homological Functoriality
Consider a map in and a -category which admits - and -shaped (co)limits. We obtain transformations of functors coming from the left and right Beck-Chevalley transformations, respectively, associated to the commuting triangle . We call the homological functoriality map and the cohomological functoriality map.
Degree of a map
Consider a map in and a symmetric -category which admits - and -shaped (co)limits and satisfies the - and -projection formula. Suppose we have Spivak data for and for . A -degree datum for is an equivalence in . We define the -degree of as the point given by the composite We say that an equivalence exhibits as a map of -degree one.
Commutative Monoid of Degrees
If the Spivak datum is -twisted ambidextrous, then the equivalence endows with the structure of a commutative algebra in . This gives the structure of a commutative monoid in with unit . with Presentably Symmetric Monoidal Coefficients Let be a map of connected Poincare spaces of the same formal dimension . We consider situations when a degree datum exists for the map with the Poincare Spivak data and for , resp. . (1) , a degree datum exists uniquely since has contractible components.
(2) For , writing for the first Stiefel-Whitney class of a space, a degree datum exists if and only if . On homotopy groups the composite then identifies with where and denote the orientation local systems. The degree is then given by , and agrees with the classical definition of the degree.
(3) In surgery theory, one is often provided with a normal map so that we have homotopy equivalences and <br>Hilman, Kaif, Dominik Kirstein, and Christian Kremer. “Parametrised Poincaré Duality and Equivariant Fixed Points Methods.” arXiv:2405.17641.

We aim to focus on intuition and examples in these notes, following the work of Bott and Tu in<a data-footref="1" href="#fn-1-bc5af654d18a7a16" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[1]</a>.We will begin with defining and computing examples for the de Rham cohomology on Euclidean space. For this purpose, let denote linear coordinates on , and let denote the -algebra generated by symbols under the relations for all and . Explicitly, is the alternating tensor algebra, or exterior algebra, on ,
As a vector space, has basis and , such that . Let denote the -algebra of functions on . Then we can define the algebra of differential forms on by tensoring:
This implies that any form in this algebra can be uniquely written as , where the are functions. This algebra is in fact graded, with multiplication
graded-commutative, in the sense that if is a -form and is a -form, then . Additionally, the algebra of differential forms is naturally equipped with a degree vector space homomorphism, , where for , and ,
We refer to the degree-1 map as the exterior differentiation on differential forms.Example
The exterior derivative can be realized as a generalization of other notions, such as curl and divergence. Consider . Then and are 1-dimensional, while and are 3-dimensional over . Because of this, we can identify -forms and -forms, via , and -forms and -forms with vector fields by and .
Then, on functions sends -forms to their gradients, on -forms maps -forms to their curl (when considering them as vector fields), and on -forms acts by sending the -form to the divergence of its associated vector field.
Let's start looking at some properties of this algebra with its exterior derivation.Exterior Derivative Satisfies Anti-Jacobian Identity
If is a -form and is a -form, then Proof.
By linearity, it suffices to prove the claim for and . We can compute *** The grading on can be seen to arise as part of a co-chain complex structure induced by , since . Indeed, for a function smooth we have
which is zero since the partials of commute while the differentials anti-commute. More generally, we have that
We refer to this resulting co-chain complex as the de Rham complex on , with its cohomology being the de Rham Cohomology of . Geometrically, an element of the -th de Rham cohomology of is represented by a cohomology class of closed -forms, which differ only by exact forms. One can think of the closed forms as being differential equations in a precise sense. Note that we could have made these definitions for any open subset, , obtaining a resulting complex with associated de Rham cohomology, .In general, the de Rham cohomology of is relatively easy to compute. Indeed, is simply connected, in fact contractible, and so a closed -form must always be exact. For 1-forms this can be derived from the fundamental theorem of calculus, while similar properties holds for higher forms. This is due to a more general fact that de Rham cohomology is actually a topological invariant.Another form of de Rham cohomology can be obtained by restricting our algebra to the algebra of smooth functions with compact support. This defines the compactly supported de Rham complex with cohomology . In this case we obtain an interesting kind of duality, with being in all degrees except , where it is . To see this, let us consider the example of along with the integration map
This linear operator vanishes on all exact -forms with having compact support since we can always restrict to an interval with endpoints outside the support of and use the fundamental theorem of calculus. Further, if we have in the kernel of the operator, then
will have compact support since does, and by the fundamental theorem of calculus . Thus,
by the first isomorphism theorem.Example
Consider where and are distinct points in . First, note that since is connected, the kernel of is precisely the constant functions, and so . Now, the kernel of TBD
Let's now start introducing some computational tools for helping us find de Rham cohomology groups. Before doing this we should expand our definition of de Rham complexes to differentiable manifolds more generally. To begin, consider a smooth map . We have a natural pullback operation on , , via
To expand this to -forms more generally, and also in such a way that defines a map of co-chain complexes, we give
where is the th component of the function . Using pullback to apply changes of coordinates, we can see that the exterior derivative is independent of the coordinate system on we are working with.Differential Forms on a Manifold
A differential form on a manifold is a collection of forms for in the atlas defining , which are compatible in the sense that for any two opens and in the atlas, with and ,
The exterior derive and wedge product are defined by extending the definitions on the individual opens in the atlas. Further, becomes a contravariant functor on the category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps using pullback.
Recall that manifolds have partitions of unity, where a partition of unity for a manifold with respect to an open cover is a collection of non-negative functions such that , is locally finite, and
We can further assume the supports of the are compact, if we wish, provided we possibly use a different index set.To begin suppose is a manifold and for and open. Then we have inclusions
Applying we get the restrictions
Taking the difference of the last two maps we obtain a short exact sequence of co-chain complexesThis is a special case of the statement that forms a flasque sheaf on . Indeed, differential forms are uniquely determined by their restrictions to open covers, so the first map is injective and the sequence is exact at the middle term. To show surjectivity of the last map take a partition of unity subordinate to the open cover . Then any -form on can be given by
where we can view and as -forms on and , respectively.<br>From the long exact sequence of homology induced by a short exact sequence of chain complexes <a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^ea9110" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^ea9110" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^ea9110</a><a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^ea9110" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^ea9110" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^ea9110</a>, we obtain the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for de Rham cohomology
where the co-boundary map takes a closed form on considers the differentials , and takes a closed -form in which maps onto it. Thus, is on and on .Support of a Form
Let be a -form on a manifold . For any we have a natural map given by evaluating coefficients at . Then the support of the -form is defined to be We can also obtain a Mayer-Vietoris sequence when working with compactly supported de Rham cohomology. Here we have to be a little careful since in general pulling back a form with compact support along a smooth map need not produce a form also with compact support. However, if we restrict to a certain subclass of smooth maps we can obtain a well-defined functor . We have two options:
Define as a contravariant functor on the category of smooth manifolds with smooth proper maps between them
Define as a covariant functor under inclusions of open sets
To see how this second definition would work, let be the inclusion o an open set. Then can be given by extending a form on by zero to a form on . For now we work with this covariant version of since it will be helpful for proving Poincare duality, even for noncompact manifolds. In this case our Mayer-Vietoris sequence looks like
which gives a long exact sequence on cohomology.Differential forms provide a wide range of tools. One of the most important such tools is their use in characterizing orientability of manifolds and the ability to integrate against them. If is a function with compact support, we denote its integral (Lebesgue or Riemann) by
where the absolute values are used to signify the difference between normal integration and integration along forms, where the order of integration matters, since it describes a local orientation on the space. We can define then its integral with respect to a standard form by
As defined thus far, this depends on a choice of coordinates. If we have a change of coordinates, i.e. a diffeomorphism, , where , for new coordinates on , then we can see that
where is the Jacobian determinant of .It follows that if , we have the change of coordinates
On the other hand, the change of variables formula reads
so , which preserves sign if is orientation-preserving, and reverses sign if is orientation-reversing.Oriented Atlas
Let be a differentiable manifold with atlas . We say that the atlas is oriented if all transition functions are orientation preserving.
A manifold is said to be orientable if it has an oriented atlas.
Next we show that being orientable is equivalent to the existence of a global non-vanishing -form (for ).Orientable in terms of -form
A manifold of dimension is orientable if and only if it has a global nowhere vanishing -form.
Proof.
First, observe that a diffeomorphism is orientation preserving if and only if is a positive multiple of at all points.() First suppose has a nowhere vanishing -form . Now, let be a coordinate map on an atlas in . Then for some smooth function which is no-where vanishing. It follows that is either positive or negative. After possible composing with the orientation-reversing diffeomorphism given by , we can assume that all such are positive. Then, pulls to , which is a positive multiple of itself, so the resulting atlas is oriented.() Next, suppose we have an oriented atlas . Then for all , , where is a positive function. Then
Write , so , with . Take a partition of unity sub-ordinate to this atlas and define . Then at each point in , all the finitely many forms which have are also themselves positive multiples of one-another. Thus, is nowhere vanishing. *** If and are global nowhere vanishing -forms on an orientable manifold , then or some smooth non-vanishing function . If we say and are equivalent. It follows that if is connected, then we can place nowhere vanishing -forms in two equivalence classes. Either class is called an orientation on , and we write for the choice of such an orientation.Now, we can integrate over an orientable manifold , with orientation . If (a top form), we can define its integral by
where is an oriented atlas for the orientation on , and is a partition of unity with respect to this atlas, and we interpret the integrals on the right as
We now show this is independent of our choice of oriented atlas associated to and our choice of partition of unity.Invariance of Definition of Integral on Forms
For a compact top form , the integral is independent of the choice of oriented atlas and partition of unity .
Proof.
Let be a global nowhere vanishing -form associated to the orientation . Let be another oriented atlas for this orientation with partition of unity . Now as and everywhere a finite sum,
Note that is a partition of unity sub-ordinate to the cover , and so
since is orientation preserving. Thus *** If we are considering a manifold of dimension that also has boundary, then the boundary of , , is an -manifold which is oriented if is, with induced oriented atlas from an oriented atlas on .Lemma: Induced Orientation-Preserving Map on Boundary of Upper Half Space
Let be a diffeomorphism of the upper half space, where has everywhere positive Jacobian determinant. Then induces a map which as a diffeomorphism of also has positive Jacobian determinant everywhere.
Proof.<br>
We can show restricts to a diffeomorphisms of boundaries in two ways. One, suppose and . Then there exists some open neighborhood contained in the upper half plane and containing . Consider . Since the Jacobian of is non-singular, <a data-href="Basic Manifold Theory - Warner#^e4bd5b" href="reading-notes/geometry/differentiable-geometry/smooth-manifolds/basic-manifold-theory-warner.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Basic Manifold Theory - Warner &gt; ^e4bd5b</a><a data-href="Basic Manifold Theory - Warner#^e4bd5b" href="reading-notes/geometry/differentiable-geometry/smooth-manifolds/basic-manifold-theory-warner.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Basic Manifold Theory - Warner &gt; ^e4bd5b</a> implies that there exists open such that is a diffeomorphism onto an open subset of . But this is only possible if is an interior point of .Another proof can be given by using paths and differentials and the fact that for , has dimension . It remains to show that the restriction has positive Jacobian determinant. Let , so is given by for . By assumption we have Note for all , so for . It follows that this determinant is . Since maps the upper half-plane to itself we must have , so also . *** Note that if is the standard orientation on the upper half-plane, then the induced orientation on its boundary is defined to be the equivalence class of , where the sign is important for the purposes of Stokes's theorem. In general, if is an oriented manifold with boundary, we define the induced orientation on by the following rule: if is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of some open set in onto the upper half space , then
where .In this section we aim to investigate Stokes' theorem, which can be thought of as a vast generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, and the 3 and 2d stokes' theorems.Stokes' Theorem
If is an -form with compact support on an oriented manifold of dimension , and if is given the induced orientation, then Proof.
We will prove the claim through several cases:(Case 1: ) By linearity of integration we can consider , so . By Fubini's theorem we can write
since is compactly supported. But because has compact support. Since , this proves Stokes' theorem for .(Case 2: ) Write
Then
Since each is compactly supported, we can use Fubini's theorem and the fundamental theorem of calculus to compute Thus, where the last equality holds since is zero when restricted to .(General Case) Let be a manifold of dimension with boundary . Let be an oriented atlas for and let be a partition of unity subordinate to this atlas. Write . Since Stokes' theorem is linear in and the sum is locally finite, it suffices to prove the claim for any , which has compact support contained in . Since either is a diffeomorphism to or , the previous computations about Stokes' theorem in the first two cases hold. Thus, we have *** <br>Bott, R., &amp; Tu, L. W. (1982).

TODO: Add details and do version for augmented virtual double categories
We also have comma objects.Lemma 1 (Comma Objects in and ).
The -categories and admit all comma objects.
Proof.
Consider the cospan of virtual double categories (resp. augmented virtual double categories). I claim that the comma virtual double category in (resp. ) can be given by the (augmented) virtual double category with the following data:
The ordinary comma category as its category of tight morphisms
For any two objects , the class of cells A -cell consists of a pair of -cells, as below
such that we have the pasting equalitySince and preserve identities and composites strictly, this data indeed defines a(n) (augmented) virtual double category, which comes equipped with a natural squarewhere the tight arrows and the cells of the transformation are given by those for the objects and loose arrows in . When all (augmented) virtual double categories involved are representable, and and are strict virtual double functors between representable double categories, with TBC
□Recall that for virtual double categories and , a virtual profunctor consists of an ordinary profunctor (i.e. a functor ) together with the following:
For every string of loose arrows in , and each loose arrow in , as well as elements and , a collection of hetero-cells
which are acted on above by cells in and below by cells in , compatible with the action of tight arrows from . These are the loose morphisms in a virtual equipment where is the free category monad on , which extends to a monad on the virtual equipment . The objects are precisely (small) virtual double categories, with homomorphisms being virtual double functors, modules being virtual profunctors, and cells being generalized virtual transformations explicate this. Explicitly, given virtual double categories and with their underlying spans of graphs and , a virtual profunctor consists of a graph which is part of a spantogether with maps of spans of graphswhich are compatible up to natural isomorphisms.This recovers the notion of (virtual) tight bimodules (virtual double categories over the walking tight arrow ).Given maps of VD categories , , and a tight bimodule , the restriction has hetero-cells for a sequence of loose arrows in , a loose arrow in , and a hetero-cell in . For instance, if is a VD functor, then its companion is the tight bimodule with hetero-cells given by multi-cellsin with a loose arrow in . Dually, its conjoint is the tight bimodule with hetero-cells given by multi-cellsfor loose arrows in .Recall that category bimodules are either equivalent to profunctors , or to functors over the walking arrow , via the collage-construction.

□We will write when being vague about which of these two equivalent double categories we are considering. We can also represent using limit sketches. Let denote the -category of (non-weighted) sketches, sketch morphisms, and arbitrary natural transformations.Example 2 (Simplex Limit Sketch).
We can view as a limit sketch by declaring its marked cones to be those given by all inert maps to objects and from an object . Recall that the inert maps in are those injective maps which are surjective onto a segment of . These are precisely the injective maps generated by the edge face maps . Let denote the full subcategory of spanned by and . Then the cones are precisely those functors for each .
The models for this limit sketch in are those simplicial sets satisfying the Segal condition, which is to say the induced maps are isomorphisms. This recovers the essential image of the nerve .
This is a special case of the construction for an algebraic pattern , which is a small category with an orthogonal factorization system and a full subcategory of elementary objects. Then has the structure of a limit sketch with marked cones
for all .Note that if is a sketch and , then the slice category gets the structure of a sketch where a marked cone in determines a unique marked cone for each in using the natural isomorphism .Definition 3 (Bimodule in a Category ).
A bimodule in , for a category, is a model for the limit sketch in . Note that . This notation is used since we have an isomorphism . Recall that is the limit sketch whose objects are morphisms in (i.e. morphisms in ), and whose morphisms are commuting triangles. Note that this is precisely the opposite of the full subcategory , which under our previous isomorphism corresponds to profunctors such that is the singleton for all and . The marked cones are the compositesfor each simplex map , which we can think of as a primitive category bimodule.Note that an object of consists of the following data:
For each primitive category bimodule , an object For each map of category bimodules a morphism in For each primitive category bimodule , a limit cone which takes the form
so that the natural mapis an isomorphism in . In analogy with Segal simplicial sets, we can consider the primitive category bimodules as giving and as the domain and codomain of the bimodule, as the carrier, and and as objects of left and right actions, respectively.

Given a limit sketch and a model , there is an isomorphism where is given the structure of a limit sketch by marking all lifts of marked cones in along the projection .

Question
Why is it pseudo-bimodules in in the forest
To begin, recall that we have strict -functors and , with the second of which being fully-faithful PROVE THIS!!. In particular, via we can consider the walking loose arrow as a unital augmented virtual double category, while then realizes it also as a unital virtual double category.We will write for the unital VDC, while will denote the non-unital VDC with two objects and a sngle loose arrow between them. Recall we have a 2-comonad given by forgetting non-identity -ary cells, the coalgebra 2-category of which being . We will proceed using the language of AVDCs, specifying the difference between the general case and the case of diminished AVDCs to encapsulate the behaviour for ordinary VDCs.Definition 5 (Loose Bimodule on s).
A loose bimodule is an augmented virtual double functor into the unital walking loose arrow, where is an augmented virtual double category. We write for the slice -category of loose bimodules.
Diagrammatically we can depict this situation by a pair of pullbacks<br>Note that a loose bimodule in this sense agrees with a loose bimodule in the sense of <a data-href="Loose Bimodules and Their Construction - Scrap Notes#^4fe56e" href="reading-notes/category-theory/categorical-algebra/loose-bimodules-and-their-construction-scrap-notes.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Loose Bimodules and Their Construction - Scrap Notes &gt; ^4fe56e</a><a data-href="Loose Bimodules and Their Construction - Scrap Notes#^4fe56e" href="reading-notes/category-theory/categorical-algebra/loose-bimodules-and-their-construction-scrap-notes.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Loose Bimodules and Their Construction - Scrap Notes &gt; ^4fe56e</a> when is representable, which is to say it's in the image of . We write and for the source and target of the augmented virtual loose bimodule. Recall that if is a (strict) double category, a loose bimodule is equivalent to a bimodule between monoids in , which consists of span of categories together with functors and which satisfy the bimodule axioms.On the other hand, when is an AVDC, a AVD-functor can be explicated as the following data:
An AVDC over and an AVDC over For each pair of objects and , a set of loose arrows , lying over the non-identity loose arrow in For each sequence of loose arrows in and in , along with tight arrows and , and loose arrows and , a collection of cells For pair of cells and , along with sequences of cells and , a composite cell
If is a diminished AVDC (i.e. an ordinary VDC) then the data is identical, with the one change that and are also diminished AVDCs (i.e. VDCs).Remark 6 (Underline Notation).
In the above work, a loose arrow with an underline, such as , represents to a sequence of loose arrows , while a cell with an underline, such as notates a sequence of - and -coary cells.
Question
Does match an existing structure?
If instead we consider AVD functors into the non-unital loose arrow, , the data is encapsulated as follows: -categories and over and , respectively
A category together with projections and to the underlying categories of the -categories
If denotes the set of cells in , then we have compatible action maps and which preserve sources and targets, and are strictly compatible under vertical composition in the sense that we have the equalities
<br>Note that if is a VDC then this forces that is a strict double category with no composable arrows, and this data is equivalent to a span of categories , with no additional data. Morphisms correspond to -functors together with a functor which is compatible with the under sources and targets, and equivariant with respect with respect to the actions on either side. Finally, -cells , given by (unital) oplax transformations (c.f. <a data-href="(Augmented) Virtual Double Categories and Generalized Multicategories#^8eb051" href="reading-notes/category-theory/double-categories/virtual-double-categories/(augmented)-virtual-double-categories-and-generalized-multicategories.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">(Augmented) Virtual Double Categories and Generalized Multicategories &gt; ^8eb051</a><a data-href="(Augmented) Virtual Double Categories and Generalized Multicategories#^8eb051" href="reading-notes/category-theory/double-categories/virtual-double-categories/(augmented)-virtual-double-categories-and-generalized-multicategories.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Definition 5 (Lax AVD Transformation)</a>) correspond to lax transformations (because of the arrow convention above) together with for each object in the carrier, a cell , which form a natural family up to the action by the lax transformations, which is to sayQuestion
Is this a known structure?
In particular, it follows that is isomorphic to the -category whose objects are spans of categories, whose morphisms are maps of spans, and whose cells are compatible natural transformations between the morphisms in the maps of spans.<br>Recall that as in<a data-footref="3" href="#fn-2-476d6976e1bb0179" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a> a diminished AVDC (i.e. a VDC with whiskering) is equivalent to the data of a weak segal fibration for the algebraic pattern , which is to (i) admits cocartesian lifts of all inert morphisms (i.e. inclusions of sub-intervals, )
(ii) For each the functor induced by the cocartesian arrows is an equivalence of categories
(iii) For every morphism in and , composition with cocartesian morphisms over the inert morphisms gives an isomorphism
Explicate: For such a functor , the fiber is the tight category for the diminished AVDC, while the objects of are pro-arrows between objects in . By (ii), the objects of for is a sequence of pro-arrows . By (iii) a morphism lying over consists of a sequence of morphisms for each , which we picture as a cell with loose For example, is represented The data for such a loose bimodule is equivalent to the data of a twisted virtual double functor where is the pseudo-double category of categories, functors, profunctors, and profunctor transformations, interpreted as an augmented virtual double category via .Definition 7 (Twisted Virtual Double Functor).
For augmented virtual double categories , a twisted virtual double functor consists of the following data: An assignment on objects For each sequence of loose arrows a tight arrow which is functorial in the sense that For each tight arrow a profunctor , which is pseudo-functorial, which is to say that if is another tight arrow, then is given by composition of profunctors For each multi-cell , a transformation of profunctors
Add coherence details Case for VDCs (not AVDCs)
In our current situation the twisted virtual double functor is given by sending a pair of objects to the category with objects pairs of integers and sequences of tight morphisms, and with morphisms consisting of a
a poset map preserving top and bottom elements along with tight arrows and cellsComposition is given by composing poset maps and vertical composition of cells in .Sequences of loose arrows then induce functors given by pasting on identity cells, and this assignment is functorial with respect to concatenation of loose arrows in either variable. Explicitly, an object is sent to where denotes concatenation, and morphism below left, corresponding to a sequence of cells in , is sent to the concatenation below rightFor each pair of tight arrows , a profunctor given by the functor that sends pairs of objects and to the set of sequences of cells of the form to the set of maps, analogously to those in , but with tight source and tight target . The action on morphisms is given by vertical composition of such sequences of cells.Additionally, observe that a map of loose bimodules corresponds in this language to virtual double functors and together with a transformation of twisted virtual double functors from to given by the following data:
For each pair of objects , a functor For each pair of tight arrows , a profunctor transformation
given by a natural transformation which at is given by applying to the resulting cells in .Definition 8 (Transformation of Twisted Virtual Double Functors).
Given twisted virtual double functors , a transformation of twisted virtual double functors consists of A tight arrow for all objects A cell, as below, for all tight arrows , satisfying cellular naturality Finally, a virtual transformation over is equivalent to a modification between transformations of twisted virtual double functors. This consists of the following data:
Virtual transformations and For each pair of objects , a profunctor transformation
given by a natural transformationwhich at is given by pasting with the squares, for a loose morphism in .
TODO: Make this all explicit with diagram
Note: Technically only one loose arrow in a given sequence over the loose arrow can lie over (all other ones need to be in one of the fibers) - maybe use this in formalizing the above?
In this way we get a fully-faithful embeddingwhere on the right is the very large -category of locally small augmented virtual double categories.
TODO: Make this precise and formulate as a theorem
One of the essential benefits of this perspective is that we immediately obtain that the -categories involved are pro-arrow equipments. Indeed, has all restrictions, and these induce restrictions for TODO: Generalize this and state it as a proposition
In particular, any virtual double functor induces a 2-functor(pseudo-functor?)
TODO: Prove this
We will write for the virtual equipment of augmented virtual double categories, tight -cells the virtual double functors between them, loose -cells the loose bimodules, and -cells of the form<br>Recall that in the sense of Leinster's Higher Operads, Higher Category Theory, the -category of pseudo-models of , which is given a -category structure by labelling its inerts as tight morphisms, is equivalent to the -category of unbiased weak double categories, -weak double functors, and tight transformations, with the tight morphisms being strict double functors.

<br>In this subsection we discuss the non-existence of a natural associative composition for loose bimodules, with argument following that in<a data-footref="2" href="#fn-3-476d6976e1bb0179" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a>. Let be the walking tight arrow, let be the walking tight composite, and let be the double category with two non-identity tight arrows and , and one non-identity loose arrow , with no non-identity cells. Using the barrel perspective on loose bimodules we then define bimodules , , and as inandTogether these loose bimodules can be represented by the diagramNow, towards a contradiction suppose we had a pseudo-associative notion of composition satisfying , Firstly, we define the VDC to be the sub-VDC of whose loose arrows consist of two-sided codiscrete cofibrations:VDC's internal to If we can make sense of VDCs internal to another category, is a virtual double 2-category?
Question
Is a pro-representable VDC?
Question
Is there a Grothendieck type construction for VD functors into ?
In addition to restriction of loose bimodules we can also consider collapse of loose bimodules. This is most easily defined in the context of two-sided double fibrations , where we simply post-compose by the unique map into the terminal double category. This construction defines loose bimodule , and in fact we get a cartesian 2-functorIn particular, we get induced 2-functorsWe also have the cartesian pseudo-functor , and hence the pseudo-functorsandWe then get a natural cartesian 2-functor such that the composite lands in , the full sub--category of symmetric monoidal loose right modules. Explicitly, this sends a symmetric monoidal loose bimodule to the nichewhere the left pseudo double-functor picks out the loose unit for the domain of the loose bimodule. In the language of two-sided double fibrations these two pseudo-functors on symmetric monoidal loose bimodules correspond to andIn particular, we see that we get a natural comparison map
Claim: This extends into a pseudo-natural transformation .
Recall that given a two-sided double fibration , the associated loose bimodule has for and those loose arrows which are objects of lying over and on the left and right. Thus, is given by the following data:
The terminal double category lying over and the double category lying over For each , and each pro-arrow in over the walking loose arrow, a pro-arrow , and for each cell in over the walking loose arrow below left, a cell in below right Composition on the left is strictly unital, while composition on the right is given as in using the description of loose arrows and cells as above.
Vertical composition of cells over the walking loose arrow is given as below:
using the vertical composition in .Example 9 (-categorical Example).
Let be a symmetric monoidal -category, so that we have the natural symmetric monoidal hom-two sided (discrete) fibration , which corresponds to the (discrete) bimodule , or the profunctor . The collapse corresponds to the (not necessarily discrete) two-sided fibration , or the profunctor , or the bimodule .
We now discuss a bimodule-oriented notion of loose adjunction.Definition 10 (Loose Adjunction).
Given virtual double functors , a lax loose adjunction between them consists of an adjunction of loose bimodules . <br>Libkind, S., Jaz Meyers, D., Carlson, K. (2025).
