Specifically, we will be illustrating the tools that cohomology gives us which aren't visible in homology (or are less straight forward to study in homology). Some of these features include cohomology groups, the ring structure on cohomology, and its Poincare duality characteristics.The contravariance of the cohomology functors make them much more accessible to these algebraic constructions we are going to investigate. However, as we will see, under certain assumptions the homology groups determine the cohomology groups.The main difficulty with defining a product on homology is that we want a map , which requires a map , but no such canonical map exists which doesn't lose information from one of the factors of . On the other hand, having a map is the same as a map , for which there is a natural such map, the diagonal. Such a map gives a variety of useful properties in cohomologyIn both the case of homology and cohomology we also have a cross product map (and similarly for cohomology) which in cellular homology sends cells of and of to the product cell in the product CW complex .Note that we have quite a bit of freedom when working with cohomology groups. In particular, for any abelian group , we can consider cohomology with coefficients in by forming the dual complex of a chain complex with respect to a group . We will begin by establishing that there, in a sense, is a universal such coefficient group, namely , and in what ways it is universal.To begin, let be a chain complex of finitely generated free abelian groups, . For , let denote the rank of , so . Thus, up to isomorphism the complex is of the form
where can be thought of as an matrix with coefficients in . As with any chain complex, we can view as consisting of a collection of SESs with connecting maps between images and kernels<br><img src="images/svg-cache/a8fbc6719370ea5fcf3846e2e6702e2d.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">Since submodules of free -modules are free of rank at most the rank of when is a PID, each of these short exact sequences split. (here we used the splitting lemma for Abelian categories to see that each sequence split by witnessing a retraction of the left inclusion) Let be the copy of in the splitting of , and , so we have sequences where the map is the restriction of the boundary map. It follows that is a direct sum of such short exact sequences.Now, let denote the rank of in and denote the rank of in , so . We can order the rows and columns of , we note that for all and all , and for all and all , . Thus, the boundary map is determined by the sub-block, . Note that we can transpose rows or columns and add linear combinations of rows or columns to give different bases for the free groups with a reduced boundary map matrix. This type of procedure allows us to express as direct sums of , , and for various . Taking duals we get the same decomposition, but with the arrows reversed, and this has the effect of shifting the torsion in the homology groups up a dimension.We aim to show that is determined by and . This is possible, but it is important to now that in general is not just the dual group. However, we always have a natural map . Indeed, if is in the kernel of the co-boundary map, so is trivial, then we obtain an induced map , which lives in . Further, if , the .Note that is surjective since the short exact sequence
splits, as all groups involved are free since subgroups of free abelian groups are free. Thus, we obtain a short exact sequence
Further, this short exact sequence is actually split since the splitting of the last sequence gives a retraction , and so any , which gives a map , can be extended to a map which vanishes on , and so lies in . Thus, composing with the quotient we get our desired section . It remains to show that depends only on and the homology of . First, note that we have a short exact sequence of chain complexes
where the cycle and boundary complexes are equipped with zero maps between each degree. Taking duals this gives a short exact sequence in the opposite direction
We then obtain a long exact sequence of homology groups for these cochain complexes,
where we have used the fact that the homology of a complex with all boundary maps zero is just the groups in the complex. When we break up this long exact sequence into short exact sequences we obtain the sequence
using exactness of the long exact sequence. But consists of those such that , which is equivalent to maps . In other words , and under this isomorphism the map becomes , and thus
Note that taking the dual of the short exact sequence
we obtain a sequence
which is generally not exact at . When it is exact we must have , and so would be an isomorphism. For example, this occurs when the original sequence splits, such as if is free.Note that since and are free, the short exact sequence for witnesses a free resolution of . Thus, the homology groups of the dual describe ext groups. Explicitly, we have that
and
The left hand group only depends on and from the following general fact in homological algebra.Independence of Resolution in Ext Groups
Let be an abelian category. If and are projective resolutions of and in , respectively, then every homomorphism extends to a map of augmented chain complexes , and any two such extensions are chain homotopic.
For any two projective resolutions and of an object in , there are natural isomorphisms for all . Proof.
For (1) we construct inductively using the definition of projective objects.<br><img src="images/svg-cache/13bfc13675a4f01e1b6e37b694ffd51a.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">For , we use the fact is projective and that is surjective to obtain making the square commute.

Then we can apply the fact that is a projective module to obtain a map making the whole diagram commute. Hence, by induction we obtain a map of chain complexes . Suppose we had another lift, . Then set to be the zero map. If we have constructed up to , satisfying the chain condition, then we define in the diagram<br><img src="images/svg-cache/10fe43ab4051d3dc1bd0672b16daac40.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">using the fact that is projective. Explicitly, we want to lift the map . For this, observe that
so factors through , by exactness, and so we can apply the fact that is projective to lift along the surjective map , giving the desired . Inductively we obtain our desired chain homotopy, and since , this is also a chain homotopy between the maps from to without the augmentation.For part (2) let and be projective resolutions of a single object . Then by part (1) the identity map extends to a map and a map . Further, by the second part of (1) any two such extensions are homotopic, and in fact and are chain homotopic to the identity map. Thus, and form a chain homotopy equivalence between projective resolutions. Taking duals with respect to some abelian group , and form a chain homotopy equivalence still, so they induce isomorphisms on homology. In other words, we have that
for all . Note that these isomorphisms do not depend on our choice of lift since all choices are chain homotopic. *** Thus, the definition of the derived functor depends only on and . The summary of this work gives the following result:Theorem: Universal Coefficient Theorem for Cohomology
If is a chain complex of projective modules over a ring where (and hence both and are projective), then for any -module , the cohomology modules of the dual complex fit into a natural exact sequence

A pairing of -modules and with values in is an -module homomorphism of the form
If is the dual map, we say the pairing is perfect when is an isomorphism of -modules.
A pairing is called non-degenerate on the right if the adjoint is injective and non-degenerate on the left if the adjoint is injective.
A pairing is called alternating if and , and so we obtain an induced alternating pairing
Similarly, the pairing is called symmetric if , so we obtain a pairing In our case we consider the pairing on a chain complex by taking its dual , where is an -module. Then our pairing at each degree is
given by evaluation . Note that by construction this pairing is perfect since its adjoint is the identity , and hence also non-degenerate on the left. Further, this pairing satisfies additional graded differential properties.Properties of Chain-Cochain Pairing
Let be a chain complex with dual . Then for any and ,

For the first claim we compute
while for the second claim ***
This pairing descends to a pairing between cohomology and homology:Pairing on (co)Homology
Let be a chain complex. Then the pairing descends to a pairing on (co)homology

FINISH PROOF of cellular cohomology. *** Path connectedness
If is a path connected space, then .
Proof.
Let be a path-connected space. We recall that is exactly the kernel of the co-boundary map . Next, we recall that can be identified with the free abelian group on the set of points of , and is the free abelian group on the set of paths in . Further, is given on generators by sending a path to the signed difference of its endpoints .Now, suppose is a cocycle, so is in . Then in particular this implies that the composite is the zero map. Since is path connected, for any , which correspond to maps , we have a path with and . Thus, we have that
As were arbitrary, must be constant on generators in . On the other hand, if is constant on generators in the sense that for all , then for any generator in ,
Thus, , so . In particular, if denotes the map defined on an arbitrary generator by by , then the cocycles in are exactly
Thus, we can define a map by the universal property of free groups by sending the generator to , which is necessarily a surjective map by our above description. Additionally, if is any point, then for , if and only if , so is also injective as long as is non-empty, and hence we have an isomorphism
for a non-empty path-connected space, while the cohomology for an empty space is trivial. ***Now that we have dualized a number of our properties from homology theory we want to begin exploring some of the new tools that cohomology theory gives us. The first, and most important, such tool will be the natural product structure on cohomology, turning it into a ring.For this section we consider cohomology with coefficients in a fixed ring throughout. Then we have a graded map making into a graded ring, where and are sent to their cup product , which is the co-chain whose value on a singular simplex is given by
where multiplication is taken in on the right. In order for this to descend to cohomology we need a description of the boundary of a cup product.Boundary of Cup Product
Let and . Then Proof.
Let . Then we haveas desired. *** It follows that if and are cocycles, then so is , so the product restricts to a product on cocycles. Further, for any and a cocycle,

For continuous, the induced maps is a map of graded rings.

As discussed above the cup product gives the structure of a graded commutative ring whenever is commutative, where products are extended to non-homogeneous elements by linearity. Similarly, we have that is a graded commutative ring with respect to the relative cup product. Further, these can be easily upgraded to graded -algebras.If is a homogeneous element (i.e. is represented by a cocycle), we refer to as the degree or dimension of .Projective Space over In general we have that the cohomology ring for with coefficients in can be given by

A natural question to ask at this point is the following:Question: The Realization Problem
Which graded commutative -algebras occur as cup product algebras of spaces ?
This turns out to be a very difficult problem, with degree of difficulty dependent on the coordinate ring .We now aim to display a connection between cup products and product spaces. To begin in this direction we define the cross product or external cup product on cohomology. This is a map
given by , where and are the projections. This is a bilinear mapping since the cup product is bilinear. In particular, this is not a map of graded rings. However, replacing the product on the left by a tensor product we do obtain a map of graded -modules
Further, this is in fact a graded ring homomorphism, where in general the tensor of graded -algebras has product defined by
We now wish to determine when this map is an isomorphism of graded rings.Theorem: Absolute Kunneth Formula
The external cross product for spaces and is an isomorphism of graded rings if and are CW complexes and is a finitely generated free -module for all .

For this purpose, let denote linear coordinates on , and let denote the -algebra generated by symbols under the relations for all and . Explicitly, is the alternating tensor algebra, or exterior algebra, on ,
As a vector space, has basis and , such that . Let denote the -algebra of functions on . Then we can define the algebra of differential forms on by tensoring:
This implies that any form in this algebra can be uniquely written as , where the are functions. This algebra is in fact graded, with multiplication
graded-commutative, in the sense that if is a -form and is a -form, then . Additionally, the algebra of differential forms is naturally equipped with a degree vector space homomorphism, , where for , and ,
We refer to the degree-1 map as the exterior differentiation on differential forms.Example
The exterior derivative can be realized as a generalization of other notions, such as curl and divergence. Consider . Then and are 1-dimensional, while and are 3-dimensional over . Because of this, we can identify -forms and -forms, via , and -forms and -forms with vector fields by and .
Then, on functions sends -forms to their gradients, on -forms maps -forms to their curl (when considering them as vector fields), and on -forms acts by sending the -form to the divergence of its associated vector field.
Let's start looking at some properties of this algebra with its exterior derivation.Exterior Derivative Satisfies Anti-Jacobian Identity
If is a -form and is a -form, then Proof.
By linearity, it suffices to prove the claim for and . We can compute *** The grading on can be seen to arise as part of a co-chain complex structure induced by , since . Indeed, for a function smooth we have
which is zero since the partials of commute while the differentials anti-commute. More generally, we have that
We refer to this resulting co-chain complex as the de Rham complex on , with its cohomology being the de Rham Cohomology of . Geometrically, an element of the -th de Rham cohomology of is represented by a cohomology class of closed -forms, which differ only by exact forms. One can think of the closed forms as being differential equations in a precise sense. Note that we could have made these definitions for any open subset, , obtaining a resulting complex with associated de Rham cohomology, .In general, the de Rham cohomology of is relatively easy to compute. Indeed, is simply connected, in fact contractible, and so a closed -form must always be exact. For 1-forms this can be derived from the fundamental theorem of calculus, while similar properties holds for higher forms. This is due to a more general fact that de Rham cohomology is actually a topological invariant.Another form of de Rham cohomology can be obtained by restricting our algebra to the algebra of smooth functions with compact support. This defines the compactly supported de Rham complex with cohomology . In this case we obtain an interesting kind of duality, with being in all degrees except , where it is . To see this, let us consider the example of along with the integration map
This linear operator vanishes on all exact -forms with having compact support since we can always restrict to an interval with endpoints outside the support of and use the fundamental theorem of calculus. Further, if we have in the kernel of the operator, then
will have compact support since does, and by the fundamental theorem of calculus . Thus,
by the first isomorphism theorem.Example
Consider where and are distinct points in . First, note that since is connected, the kernel of is precisely the constant functions, and so . Now, the kernel of TBD
Let's now start introducing some computational tools for helping us find de Rham cohomology groups. Before doing this we should expand our definition of de Rham complexes to differentiable manifolds more generally. To begin, consider a smooth map . We have a natural pullback operation on , , via
To expand this to -forms more generally, and also in such a way that defines a map of co-chain complexes, we give
where is the th component of the function . Using pullback to apply changes of coordinates, we can see that the exterior derivative is independent of the coordinate system on we are working with.Differential Forms on a Manifold
A differential form on a manifold is a collection of forms for in the atlas defining , which are compatible in the sense that for any two opens and in the atlas, with and ,
The exterior derive and wedge product are defined by extending the definitions on the individual opens in the atlas. Further, becomes a contravariant functor on the category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps using pullback.
Recall that manifolds have partitions of unity, where a partition of unity for a manifold with respect to an open cover is a collection of non-negative functions such that , is locally finite, and
We can further assume the supports of the are compact, if we wish, provided we possibly use a different index set.To begin suppose is a manifold and for and open. Then we have inclusions
Applying we get the restrictions
Taking the difference of the last two maps we obtain a short exact sequence of co-chain complexesThis is a special case of the statement that forms a flasque sheaf on . Indeed, differential forms are uniquely determined by their restrictions to open covers, so the first map is injective and the sequence is exact at the middle term. To show surjectivity of the last map take a partition of unity subordinate to the open cover . Then any -form on can be given by

where the co-boundary map takes a closed form on considers the differentials , and takes a closed -form in which maps onto it. Thus, is on and on .Support of a Form
Let be a -form on a manifold . For any we have a natural map given by evaluating coefficients at . Then the support of the -form is defined to be We can also obtain a Mayer-Vietoris sequence when working with compactly supported de Rham cohomology. Here we have to be a little careful since in general pulling back a form with compact support along a smooth map need not produce a form also with compact support. However, if we restrict to a certain subclass of smooth maps we can obtain a well-defined functor . We have two options:
Define as a contravariant functor on the category of smooth manifolds with smooth proper maps between them
Define as a covariant functor under inclusions of open sets
To see how this second definition would work, let be the inclusion o an open set. Then can be given by extending a form on by zero to a form on . For now we work with this covariant version of since it will be helpful for proving Poincare duality, even for noncompact manifolds. In this case our Mayer-Vietoris sequence looks like
which gives a long exact sequence on cohomology.Differential forms provide a wide range of tools. One of the most important such tools is their use in characterizing orientability of manifolds and the ability to integrate against them. If is a function with compact support, we denote its integral (Lebesgue or Riemann) by
where the absolute values are used to signify the difference between normal integration and integration along forms, where the order of integration matters, since it describes a local orientation on the space. We can define then its integral with respect to a standard form by
As defined thus far, this depends on a choice of coordinates. If we have a change of coordinates, i.e. a diffeomorphism, , where , for new coordinates on , then we can see that
where is the Jacobian determinant of .It follows that if , we have the change of coordinates
On the other hand, the change of variables formula reads
so , which preserves sign if is orientation-preserving, and reverses sign if is orientation-reversing.Oriented Atlas
Let be a differentiable manifold with atlas . We say that the atlas is oriented if all transition functions are orientation preserving.
A manifold is said to be orientable if it has an oriented atlas.
Next we show that being orientable is equivalent to the existence of a global non-vanishing -form (for ).Orientable in terms of -form
A manifold of dimension is orientable if and only if it has a global nowhere vanishing -form.
Proof.
First, observe that a diffeomorphism is orientation preserving if and only if is a positive multiple of at all points.() First suppose has a nowhere vanishing -form . Now, let be a coordinate map on an atlas in . Then for some smooth function which is no-where vanishing. It follows that is either positive or negative. After possible composing with the orientation-reversing diffeomorphism given by , we can assume that all such are positive. Then, pulls to , which is a positive multiple of itself, so the resulting atlas is oriented.() Next, suppose we have an oriented atlas . Then for all , , where is a positive function. Then
Write , so , with . Take a partition of unity sub-ordinate to this atlas and define . Then at each point in , all the finitely many forms which have are also themselves positive multiples of one-another. Thus, is nowhere vanishing. *** If and are global nowhere vanishing -forms on an orientable manifold , then or some smooth non-vanishing function . If we say and are equivalent. It follows that if is connected, then we can place nowhere vanishing -forms in two equivalence classes. Either class is called an orientation on , and we write for the choice of such an orientation.Now, we can integrate over an orientable manifold , with orientation . If (a top form), we can define its integral by
where is an oriented atlas for the orientation on , and is a partition of unity with respect to this atlas, and we interpret the integrals on the right as
We now show this is independent of our choice of oriented atlas associated to and our choice of partition of unity.Invariance of Definition of Integral on Forms
For a compact top form , the integral is independent of the choice of oriented atlas and partition of unity .
Proof.
Let be a global nowhere vanishing -form associated to the orientation . Let be another oriented atlas for this orientation with partition of unity . Now as and everywhere a finite sum,
Note that is a partition of unity sub-ordinate to the cover , and so
since is orientation preserving. Thus *** If we are considering a manifold of dimension that also has boundary, then the boundary of , , is an -manifold which is oriented if is, with induced oriented atlas from an oriented atlas on .Lemma: Induced Orientation-Preserving Map on Boundary of Upper Half Space

It remains to show that the restriction has positive Jacobian determinant. Let , so is given by for . By assumption we have Note for all , so for . It follows that this determinant is . Since maps the upper half-plane to itself we must have , so also . *** Note that if is the standard orientation on the upper half-plane, then the induced orientation on its boundary is defined to be the equivalence class of , where the sign is important for the purposes of Stokes's theorem. In general, if is an oriented manifold with boundary, we define the induced orientation on by the following rule: if is an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of some open set in onto the upper half space , then
where .In this section we aim to investigate Stokes' theorem, which can be thought of as a vast generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus, the divergence theorem, and the 3 and 2d stokes' theorems.Stokes' Theorem
If is an -form with compact support on an oriented manifold of dimension , and if is given the induced orientation, then Proof.
We will prove the claim through several cases:(Case 1: ) By linearity of integration we can consider , so . By Fubini's theorem we can write

Then
Since each is compactly supported, we can use Fubini's theorem and the fundamental theorem of calculus to compute Thus, where the last equality holds since is zero when restricted to .(General Case) Let be a manifold of dimension with boundary . Let be an oriented atlas for and let be a partition of unity subordinate to this atlas. Write . Since Stokes' theorem is linear in and the sum is locally finite, it suffices to prove the claim for any , which has compact support contained in . Since either is a diffeomorphism to or , the previous computations about Stokes' theorem in the first two cases hold. Thus, we have *** <br>Bott, R., &amp; Tu, L. W. (1982).

Homology is an algebraic homotopy invariant of spaces which are incredibly important, largely due to their better computability over higher homotopy groups. In particular, simplicial, or sometimes called cellular homology, gives an explicit algorithm for computing all homology groups for a CW complex from the combinatorial data of its cell structure, with the chain complex defining the homology groups encoding cells in each dimension and attaching data in the boundary maps of the chain complex.The fundamental building block for simplicial homology is the -simplex. We state the definition of the -simplex purely abstractly, though in most applications an -simplex is viewed as a subspace of Euclidean space with standard basis chosen.-simplex
An -simplex, for an integer, in an dimensional real vector space , where , associated to a collection of vectors , with linearly independent, in the subspace
where the are referred to as barycentric coordinates.
The standard -simplex is the -simplex in associated with the standard basis . We will write for an -simplex with specified vertices. For purposes of homology, and in particular for tracking orientations of boundaries, the ordering of the vertices in an -simplex will be considered part of the data. For example, such an ordering specifies a linear homeomorphism from the standard -simplex onto any other any -simplex , preserving vertices and orientations, so we can take any -simplex which is most convenient in a given situation. Indeed, such a map is given by .There are a number of important constructions and terminology associated with simplices. Firstly, removing a vertex from the list gives a face, (here the th face), of the original simplex. We will write for the union of all faces in the -simplex , and refer to it as the boundary of . Note that as a closed subspace of the ambient vector space resides in, is its interior, sometimes referred to as its open sub-simplex. For computational purposes a useful notion is that of a -complex structure or triangulation of a space . Such a structure is determined by a collection of maps , for varying , satisfying the following:
The restriction is injective, and is partitioned by the images of such injective maps
Each restriction of to a face of is one of the maps , where we identify a face of with using the natural linear homeomorphism described previously. has the weak topology with respect to the (i.e. is open if and only if is open for all )
Note that such a quotient space must be Hausdorff, so property (3) implies that the interior of any simplex is mapped homeomorphically onto its image. Indeed, a triangulation is a special form of a CW structure.Moving forward, let be a topological space that admits a triangulation, and fix such a triangulation , where indexes the -simplices in the triangulation. Let throughout, and let be the free abelian group on the set of -simplices, . Elements of are called -chains. In order to turn these groups into a chain complex we define the boundary map for to be the map obtained by the following action on basis elements , with simplex :
This indeed defines a boundary map due to the alternating behaviour of the sum, as can be checked by a straightforward computation with re-ordering and grouping summands.Therefore, for every triangulated space , with specified triangulation, we obtain its simplicial complex . The -th simplicial homology of is then the -th homology group of this chain complex, namely
Although it may not be evident right now, we will later see that these simplicial homology groups are independent of the choice of triangulation on . This will be shown by witnessing agreement with the later defined singular homology of , which does not involve such choices. We refer to elements of homology groups as homology classes, and say that two cycles representing the same homology class are homologous.Orientable Closed Surface
Consider an orientable closed surface of genus , , which we can represent by a quotient of a -gon. Order the edges on the -gon . To give a triangulation we add a vertex to the center of the -gon and then input outward oriented edges to all vertices, giving -simplices. Additionally, after identification we have -simplices and -simplices. Thus, the simplicial complex for is
where is the zero map for the edges , and mapping any edge from the center vertex to the common vertex on the -gon to . Thus, we have that
In particular, , which agrees with the fact that is path-connected. We denote the -simplices by , , where attaches to and attaches to . Then , and , . Then we have that
where we interpret . It follows that the element being acted on is in the kernel if and only if for all and for all . Thus,
so . Now, observe that we can also write the image as
Thus, we have , , , and , which span the image for each . Observe that any linear combination which is zero must reduce to the form
where . Thus, we must have that for all , giving
which holds if and only if for some fixed integer . Thus, we have a short exact sequence
so . Thus, .
Observe that the alternating sum of ranks for , is exactly the Euler characteristic of . This is a general phenomenon.Now, although useful for computations, simplicial homology is difficult to develop tools for on its on due to its strict construction. Instead we move now to the more abstract setting of singular homology, before later showing that the two agree, assuming the space has a triangulation.Moving forward, let denote an arbitrary space (i.e. no triangulation assumptions). A singular -simplex in is then a continuous map out of the standard -simplex. We can then define singular chains for to be the free abelian group on all singular -simplices, where is defined identically to the boundary maps in simplicial chains.Again, we obtain a chain complex , and we refer to the homology of this complex as the singular homology of , . One of the first immediate benefits of this definition is that is functorial, sending a continuous map of spaces to the map which at sends a basis element to its post-composition by , . In particular, this implies that singular homology is homeomorphism invariant, and in fact it is also homotopy invariant, as we will soon see. Note that we can replace be a singular complex with -complexes for each singular -complex , and evident attachings. These spaces are rarely equivalent, but by construction .We now make use of the abstract nature of singular homology do quickly derive some interesting properties.Homology in Terms of Path-Components
Let be the decomposition of a space into its path-components. Then the canonical map
is an isomorphism.
Proof.
Note that any must factor through some path-component of since is path-connected. This implies the desired isomorphism on chains, . Since taking kernels and images in commute with direct sums, and quotients commute with direct sums, we obtain the desired isomorphism on the level of homology. *** -th Homology of a Space
If is non-empty and path-connected then . Hence, for any space , .
Proof.
Note that . Consider the map sending each . Then . On the other hand, if , then . By expanding terms if necessary, we can assume that each . Then for some , so that the all cancel. After possible re-ordering we can assume for and for . Then we can group the sum as . But as is path-connected, each is in the image of , so the sum is also in the image and hence . Therefore . *** This result gives a first instance of the deep connection between homology and homotopy groups. Next we observe a type of dimension or boundedness result for singular homology.Dimension Theorem for Singular Homology
If is a point, then for , and .
Proof.<br>
The claim is <a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^f82511" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^f82511" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^f82511</a><a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^f82511" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^f82511" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^f82511</a>. Now for all , and sends the unique -simplex to the alternating sum , which is zero if and only if is odd, and otherwise. In other words, we have alternating identity and zero maps, which implies that the sequence is exact for , and so . *** Due to these two results a copy of at the th homology can sometimes be viewed as a bit superfluous, and can be annoying in computations. In order to account for this, we often will work with reduced homology groups, , which we can define as the homology of the augmented chain complex
Observe that by construction for , and we have a short exact sequence
which splits since is a free -module, so .Next we aim to show the claim, previously mentioned, that singular homology is a homotopy invariant. This is equivalent to the statement that homotopic maps are sent to identical group homomorphisms on the level of homology. We will abuse notation and write for the map induced on homology by a map . To prove this claim we first recall that chain homotopic maps of chain complexes induce the same maps on homology.Chain Homotopic Maps are Equal on Homology
Let be maps of chain complexes which are chain homotopic, so there exist maps for all such that
Then for all .
Proof.
Let be an -cycle. Then we have that
is an -boundary in , and hence zero in homology. Thus . *** Now, it suffices to show that taking singular complexes sends topologically homotopic maps to chain homotopic ones. is a Homotopical Functor
Let be homotopic maps of spaces. Then are chain homotopic.
Proof.
Let be the homotopy from to . Let and we need to define a map . Let be a singular -simplex. Now, we want to sub-divide into simplices. Let and , such that including and then projecting onto gives the same map. We interpolate between these -simplices using intermediate steps, going from to , and generally from to . Note that these are boundaries to -simplices of the form . Then in this way is the union over these -simplices.We can then define as the alternating sum
It remains to show that these maps satisfy our desired boundary condition. This, like the proof of the vanishing of boundary maps, is an index chasing argument with alternating sums. *** Note that all of these homotopy invariance results also apply equally well for reduced homology.Now that we have established homotopy invariance we move to some of the first powerful tools for working with singular homology. In particular, we aim to prove an important relationship between the homology groups , , and when . We will be able to obtain a particularly strong result when dealing with good pairs.Good Pairs
A pair of a space and a non-empty subspace is said to be a good pair if is closed and there is some open neighborhood , with , such that deformation retracts (strongly) onto .
For example, as can be proven inductively, all CW pairs are good pairs. Now, before continuing this theory we need some preliminaries which are more general and allow us to define and work with homology of pairs. These will be studied in what is known as relative homology groups. Namely, if is a space with subspace , we write for the quotient complex
Thus, we can think of chains in as being chains in which are trivial if they lie in . Our relative homology groups are then the homology groups of the chain complex , denoted . We refer to elements of these homology groups as relative cycles, where they consist of chains that have boundaries being cycles in . Such a relative cycle is homologous to if and only if it is a boundary, up to a chain in .Note that if we have a triple of space we obtain an exact sequence of chain complexes
We now aim to show that such complexes induce long exact sequences on the level of homology, which is a direct consequence of the snake lemma that we briefly recall here:<br>Theorem: Snake Lemma
If we have a map of sequences in an abelian category <img src="images/svg-cache/d7c2b7b6a544de83d31faff45146f28e.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">
where the rows are exact, then we obtain a long exact sequence Proof.
By the Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem we can prove the claim in for some ring using diagram chasing. In this case the map sends a cycle to an element of the cokernel of by snaking through the diagram. Indeed, since the top row is exact we have a for which , and then , so there exists such that . Then we define in . A simple (yet tedious) diagram chase argument shows this is a well-defined group homomorphism and gives the desired long exact sequence. *** As a simple corollary we obtain the following result on long exact sequences in homology:Corollary: Long Exact Sequence of Homology
Let be a short exact sequence of chain complexes. Then we obtain a long exact sequence on homology
with the boundary maps natural.
Proof.<br>
First, by <a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^244e61" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^244e61" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^244e61</a><a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^244e61" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^244e61" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^244e61</a> we obtain for all an exact sequence
Alternatively, we can take kernels in our second row of the snake lemma, such as , instead the whole groups, i.e. , to get the long exact sequence
Note that if , we have some with , so . But then by construction of in the snake lemma, , so kills boundaries. It follows that we obtain an induced map giving an exact sequence
Further, from our construction in the snake lemma these boundary maps commute with chain maps. *** As an immediate consequence we obtain the long exact sequence of a triple as well as the long exact sequence of the pair Applying long exact sequence of the triple to the triple we obtain the long exact sequence of reduced homology for a pair:
In these lasts two cases the boundary map takes on an especially form, simply sending a homology class in represented by a relative cycle to the class of its boundary, , which by definition of relative cycles is a cycle in , and so lands in .It follows by exactness that relative homology of a pair is trivial if and only if the inclusion induces isomorphisms on homology. An important result in the case of pairs is that we still have homotopy invariance.Homology of Pairs is Homotopical
If are homotopic as maps of pairs, then .
Proof.<br>
Since the homotopy is done through maps of pairs, the prism chain homotopy in <a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^a67bc4" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^a67bc4" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^a67bc4</a><a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^a67bc4" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^a67bc4" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^a67bc4</a> restricts to a map , and so induces relative chain homotopies . Then the same computations given previously give that this indeed defines a chain homotopy, and so . *** In order to obtain our desired result relating quotients of spaces we will need another powerful tool of homology known as excision. This will first require that we introduce and prove a result about a notion known as barycentric subdivision, which can be thought of as an argument to partition simplices in an ordered way so that we can apply a Lebesgue number lemma type result.Chains in Covers
Let be a space with a collection of subspaces whose interiors cover . Let be the subcomplex generated by simplices whose image lies in some set in the cover. Let denote the -th homology of this cover.
One of the many reasons for considering the chain complex associated to a cover comes from the following result.Exact Sequence of Cover Chain Complex
Let be an open cover on . Then there is a (split) short exact sequence
where the right map is the fold map and the left map is given on by mapping an -chain to in the coordinate, in the coordinate, and zero in all other coordinates.
Proof.
By construction the left map is injective and the right map is surjective, so it remains only to see that we have exactness at the center term. Let , so that , where since are working with sums only finitely many terms are non-zero. Let be the opens in the cover such that . Let's write , where the are distinct singular -simplices. Then we have that
We proceed by induction on . If then we must have that and after possible re-ordering for all . In this case and have image landing . Thus, we have that the element is the image of . Now, suppose the claim holds for some . Then for each we must have that lies in for some . For each choose one such , denoted , and let , and otherwise let . Then we have , and by the inductive hypothesis there exists such that its image is for and zero at all other components. On the other hand, the difference is exactly the image of
so , as desired, so the sequence is exact. ***
We now show that up to homotopy the singular chain functor is a cosheaf valued in chain complexes. This relies on the procedure of Barycentric subdivision for -simplices in order to apply the Lebesgue number lemma.Barycentric Subdivision for Covers
Let be the natural inclusion. Then is a chain homotopy equivalence, and hence induces isomorphisms on homology.
Proof.
The proof of this result will require the process known as barycentric subdivision. We proceed in four stages: Barycentric subdivision of Simplices: Consider an -simplex . We define its barycenter to be the point . We then decompose into the -simplices , where is constructed inductively as an -simplex in the barycentric subdivision of some face . If , the barycentric subdivision of is just . If , , and if , then we take , , and , as well as In particular, the vertices in the barycentric subdivision of are the barycenters of all -dimensional faces for . For these are just the original vertices. This barycentric subdivision of induces a -complex structure on in terms of simplices of diameter at most times the diameter of . Indeed, this is precisely the maximum distance between two vertices in a given simplex. For this, consider an -simplex in the subdivision, . We proceed by induction on , noting that for . If then the diameter is always zero, so there is nothing to prove. Now, let be vertices in . If neither nor are the barycenter, , then the lie in a barycenter of a common face in , so the claim holds by the inductive hypothesis. Otherwise, suppose is the barycenter. If , then
where the last max is exactly the diameter of , as desired. Barycentric Subdivision of Linear Chains: Let be a convex subset and let denote the subgroup of generated by linear maps (here a linear map is fully determined by its action on the vertices, sending all other convex linear combinations to convex linear combinations in ). Since boundary maps are given by restriction this indeed defines a sub-chain complex . For convenience we augment by .
At each point , we obtain a homomorphism given on a basis element by (note: this can be done since is convex and we are considering linear chains). This is a kind of cone operator with tip . Observe that applying boundary maps we obtain the relation
so is a chain homotopy between the identity and the zero map on , so the complex is contractible.
Now, we construct our subdivision homomorphism by induction on. Let be a linear -simplex and let be the image of the barycenter of under . Then we set . We start the induction by setting to be the identity. Note that it is also the identity when as
Geometrically, , for an -simplex which is an embedding (so a genuine -simplex in ) is an alternating sum over the barycentric subdivision of .
Now, I claim is a chain map. Since and are identities we need only check for , where , inductively. Observe we can compute
where the second last equality is by the inductive hypothesis.
Now, we construct a chain homotopy between and the identity inductively. For we set . For , we inductively define . Note that . Now, suppose . Then we compute
where we have used the inductive hypothesis and the inductive definition of . Note that since , these chain homotopy relations still hold. Barycentric Subdivision of General Chains: We can now perform barycentric subdivision in general. We define the subdivision operator in this context, , by where the inner is the for the convex space from (2). Since our original subdivision map is a chain map, so it this one. We also define the chain homotopy in the same manner, , and since the boundary formula holds for the in (2) and pushforward by a map is linear, we have that it still holds.
Thus, . <br>
Iterated Barycentric Subdivision: Now that we can perform barycentric subdivisions both geometrically and algebraically we can begin proving the claim by performing an iterated barycentric subdivision until we reach a point where the diameters of our simplices are less than the Lebesgue number for the induced covers on the . Note that since chain homotopies are transitive we can obtain a chain homotopy between and the iterate . Explicitly, such a homotopy can be given by the sum . Consider an -simplex in . Pulling back the cover , <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Lebesgue Numbers > ^23be70" data-href="Lebesgue Numbers#^23be70" href="reading-notes/geometry/topology/important-topics/lebesgue-numbers.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">the Lebesgue Number lemma</a><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Lebesgue Numbers > ^23be70" data-href="Lebesgue Numbers#^23be70" href="reading-notes/geometry/topology/important-topics/lebesgue-numbers.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">the Lebesgue Number lemma</a> along with part (1) implies that there exists an sufficiently large such that consists of simplices each of which have image in some element of , and so . Let denote the smallest integer for which lies in . Next, we define a homotopy by for all singular -simplices in . Define by , which is a chain map. as is easily computed. Further, if , Note that by definition of . Additionally, the remaining terms are linear combinations of for the restriction of to a face, so in particular . Hence, , which all lie in since since maps as it doesn't expand the image of a simplex. Thus, we can view as a chain map , where by construction we have . Further, note that is identically zero on , as for all , and and so , and consequently we have that is chain homotopy equivalent to the identity. *** We now have enough technology to state and prove the excision theorem for homology of pairs.Excision Theorem for Homology
Given subspaces such that , the inclusion induces isomorphisms on homology . Equivalently, for any such that , the inclusion induces isomorphisms on homology .
To go between the two versions of excision we can set or .Proof.<br>
We prove the second formulation of excision, so let such that , and let .

Now, observe that we have natural inclusions and . Further, consider the composite . Then the kernel of this composite is precisely , so we obtain induced maps<br>
Further, by construction the left map is in fact an isomorphism, so it remains to only see that the right map is a chain homotopy equivalence. For this, consider the homotopy defined in <a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^606674" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^606674" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^606674</a><a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^606674" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^606674" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^606674</a>. It suffices to show that maps into , so let be an -simplex with image in . Then . Now both and act by taking a map on the simplex and then pushing forward by , so each has image lying in the image of , which lies in . Thus, we obtain an induced homotopy , which gives our desired homotopy equivalence. In particular, this implies that descends to a map . *** We now have the technology to relate relative homology of a good pair to the homology of the quotient .Relative Homology of Good Pairs as Quotients
Let be a good pair. Then the quotient map induces isomorphisms for all .

Note that as , we have , and in particular . Thus, from the long exact sequence of the triple we conclude that for all , so the upper left map in the diagram is also an isomorphism. Similarly, since the deformation retract fixes it restricts to a contraction , and so the bottom left map is also an isomorphism. Finally, note that being the restriction of a quotient map to outside the quotienting region is a homeomorphism. Thus, the right hand map is an isomorphism, and the commutivity of the diagram implies that the left hand vertical map must be an isomorphism (and in fact also the middle vertical map). *** <br>We can now obtain the first of a number of important corollaries to <a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^0d0646" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^0d0646" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^0d0646</a><a data-href="Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^0d0646" href="reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^0d0646" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^0d0646</a>.Corollary: Homology of Spheres

For , is not a retract of . Hence, every map has a fixed point.
Proof.
If we had a retraction , then we would obtain a factorization of the identity

If is a CW complex with -cells, then is generated by at most elements.
If has no two of its cells in adjacent dimensions, then is free abelian with basis in one-to-one correspondence with the -cells of .

as desired.(non-)Orientable Closed Surfaces
Let be the closed orientable surface of genus with CW structure of one -cell, -cells, and one -cell which is attached according to the product . The associated cellular chain complex is
where is . Since each and appear in the product with its inverse, must also be , and hence
For the non-orientable closed surface of genus , , the attaching map is . Thus, the boundary map is specified by , since each appears with total exponent in the attaching map. It follows that 3D Torus
Let . Using the product structure on it has one -cell, three -cells, three -cells, and one -cell. Thus, our cellular chain is of the form

where the two copies of in each part of the union on the left must be sent to opposite orientation attaching maps, implying that is in fact zero. A similar argument shows that is zero, and thus the cellular chains align with the cellular homology groups.
Moore Spaces
For an abelian group and an integer , a Moore space of is a space such that and for . We will, for the sake of this work, also require that be simply-connected if .
If we can take to be with a cell attached by a map of degree . Then any finitely generated group can be obtained by taking a wedge sum of finitely many such spaces, as well as finitely many copies of .
Now, suppose is not finitely generated and let be a quotient map from a free abelian group . The kernel of this homomorphism is free, being a submodule of a free module over a PID. Let be a basis or and be a basis for , and write . Then, let , so . Then we want, for each , to attach a cell to via a map such that the composite of with the projection onto has degree . This will then give the homology groups we want.
We have map the complement of disjoint balls in to the -cell of , while sending of the balls onto the summand by maps of degree if , or degree if .

Then , and so is either or multiplication by whether is odd or even, respectively. Thus, we have that For finite CW complexes we can define their Euler characteristic by the alternating sum , where is the number of -cells of . This can be generalized to other finite dimensional spaces using homology, as the following theorem shows.Euler Characteristic in Terms of Homology
Let be a finite CW complex. Then .
Proof.
This fact can be expressed algebraically. Let
be a chain complex of finitely generated abelian groups. Then we have short exact sequences and , which implies that
and Substituting we find . The proof then follows by applying this result to the chain complex of cellular chains of . *** An important generalization of the homology theory presented thus far is homology with coefficients in abelian groups other than the integers. Explicitly,we have that
and since tensoring is left-adjoint, so commutes with colimits
Since commutes with colimits and finite limits, all of the theory we have developed thus far still applies, including all the long exact sequences we derived. All of the cellular homology work also follows through, with one additional result needed:Degree for Homology with coefficients
If has degree , then is multiplication by .
Proof.
Note that homology with coefficients in is in fact natural in , due to the fact that tensoring is a bifunctor. In particular, this implies that if we take the unique map taking to , then the naturality square that results implies that , as desired. *** Homology of Projective Space over a Field
The cellular chain complex for with coefficients in a field is
If has characteristic then for . On the other hand, if has characteristic different from , then for and , if is odd, and otherwise.
We now begin investigating some applications and interesting computations that can be done with homology. The first we will start with is the notion of degree.The notion of the degree of a map is incredibly prolific in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and beyond, and what we discuss here will only be a minor historical introduction to degree as it was investigated by Brouwer for maps of spheres.Explicitly, given a map , where , the induced map on homology is an endomorphism on an infinite cyclic group, so must be of the form for any and some fixed integer depending only on . This integer will be called the degree of , and we will refer to it as . We begin by noting some simple properties of degree that follow from properties of homology: as if is not surjective. Indeed, in this case let . Then factors through , where since is contractible. Hence .
Since homology is homotopical, if then , so the degree is a homotopy invariant. In fact, the converse is also true, though we will not prove it here. since . It follows that if is a homotopy equivalence. if is a reflection of , fixing the points in a subsphere and interchanging complementary hemispheres.
The antipodal map , , has degree since it can be realized as the composite of reflections, each changing the sign o a single coordinate in .
If has no fixed points then . For this we can consider the line segment from to given by , , which doesn't pass through the origin if . Due to this, the formula
defines a homotopy from to the antipodal map.
Let's now consider some interesting applications of degree, giving an idea for its prevalence in mathematics.Hairy-Ball Theorem has a continuous field o nonzero tangent vectors if and only if is odd.
Proof.
First, suppose is a vector field on . Note that for all , through the natural embedding of into we can realize the tangent space as the orthogonal complement of in . If for all , we can normalize it, and so suppose that is a unit length tangent field on . Then for all and , the vectors lie in the unit circle in the plane spanned by and . Taking from to we obtain a homotopy from the identity on to the antipodal map . From our previous remarks this implies that , and so , which is only possible if is odd.On the other hand, if , for some integer , we can define to obtain a tangent vector field on which is always of unit length, and hence never zero. *** Another nice application of degree is with respect to the class of groups which can act freely on the sphere, for even .Groups that can act freely on for even is the only nontrivial group that can act freely on if is even.
Proof.
Since homeomorphisms must have degree , an action of a group on determines a degree homomorphism . If the action is free, sends each nontrivial element of to by property (7) above. When is even, has trivial kernel, and this is only possible if (up to equivalence). *** As these examples have shown, degree, although a simple enough invariant to describe, can be incredibly powerful, so it is important to have sufficient tools for computing it. Consider a map , , such that we have a point with finite. Let be disjoint open neighborhoods of these points, mapped into a single neighborhood of . Then for each , so we have a diagram of homology groups<br><img src="images/svg-cache/2cf9b6a3b4e52ca48480c09afe27c5d9.svg" target="_self" style="width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;">where the isomorphisms on the top half are by excision, while the isomorphisms on the bottom half are by the long exact sequence for a pair along with the contractibility of minus a point. Due to these isomorphisms we can identify the top groups with , and so the top is determined by an integer called the local degree of at , written . If maps each homeomorphically onto , then for each . Thus, we have a powerful way of determining local degrees. We can then use these to compute global degrees.Degree from Local Degrees

Precomposing with reflections of the summands in , if needed, we can ensure each local degree is either or . Then we can produce a map with degree .
Another important result relates the degree of a map to the degree of its suspension.Suspension Preserves Degree

A reduced homology theory is a covariant functor satisfying the following axioms: (Homotopy Invariance) If , then (Exactness) There are natural boundary homomorphisms for all CW pairs fitting into an exact sequence (Additivity) For a wedge sum with inclusions , the direct sum map is an isomorphism for each . Here is the abelian category of -graded abelian groups.For a reduced homology theory , we refer to the groups as the coefficients of the homology theory. Setting , we can realize any sequence of abelian groups as the coefficient groups of a homology theory.Let's quickly conclude by showing that all homology theories, as axiomatized above, satisfy an additional Mayer-Vietoris axiom.Mayer-Vietoris Axiom for Homology Theories
Every homology theory has a Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence for all CW complexes where and are subcomplexes.
Proof.
Let be a homology theory on pairs of CW complexes and let be a CW complex with and subcomplexes.

TODO: Add details and do version for augmented virtual double categories
We also have comma objects.Lemma 1 (Comma Objects in and ).
The -categories and admit all comma objects.
Proof.
Consider the cospan of virtual double categories (resp. augmented virtual double categories). I claim that the comma virtual double category in (resp. ) can be given by the (augmented) virtual double category with the following data:
The ordinary comma category as its category of tight morphisms
For any two objects , the class of cells A -cell consists of a pair of -cells, as below
such that we have the pasting equalitySince and preserve identities and composites strictly, this data indeed defines a(n) (augmented) virtual double category, which comes equipped with a natural squarewhere the tight arrows and the cells of the transformation are given by those for the objects and loose arrows in . When all (augmented) virtual double categories involved are representable, and and are strict virtual double functors between representable double categories, with TBC
□Recall that for virtual double categories and , a virtual profunctor consists of an ordinary profunctor (i.e. a functor ) together with the following:
For every string of loose arrows in , and each loose arrow in , as well as elements and , a collection of hetero-cells
which are acted on above by cells in and below by cells in , compatible with the action of tight arrows from . These are the loose morphisms in a virtual equipment where is the free category monad on , which extends to a monad on the virtual equipment . The objects are precisely (small) virtual double categories, with homomorphisms being virtual double functors, modules being virtual profunctors, and cells being generalized virtual transformations explicate this. Explicitly, given virtual double categories and with their underlying spans of graphs and , a virtual profunctor consists of a graph which is part of a spantogether with maps of spans of graphswhich are compatible up to natural isomorphisms.This recovers the notion of (virtual) tight bimodules (virtual double categories over the walking tight arrow ).Given maps of VD categories , , and a tight bimodule , the restriction has hetero-cells for a sequence of loose arrows in , a loose arrow in , and a hetero-cell in . For instance, if is a VD functor, then its companion is the tight bimodule with hetero-cells given by multi-cellsin with a loose arrow in . Dually, its conjoint is the tight bimodule with hetero-cells given by multi-cellsfor loose arrows in .Recall that category bimodules are either equivalent to profunctors , or to functors over the walking arrow , via the collage-construction. Explicitly, we get a equivalence of pseudo-double categories<br>
where on both double categories have the same tight categories, under the correspondence in <a data-href="Fibrations in 2-Categories#^e1af7f" href="reading-notes/category-theory/higher-category-theory/fibrations/fibrations-in-2-categories.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Fibrations in 2-Categories &gt; ^e1af7f</a><a data-href="Fibrations in 2-Categories#^e1af7f" href="reading-notes/category-theory/higher-category-theory/fibrations/fibrations-in-2-categories.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Theorem 2 (Characterization of Two-sided Discrete Fibrations)</a>, and where loose arrows on the right are functors over the walking arrow with appropriate domain and codomain.
Proof.
TBD
□We will write when being vague about which of these two equivalent double categories we are considering. We can also represent using limit sketches. Let denote the -category of (non-weighted) sketches, sketch morphisms, and arbitrary natural transformations.Example 2 (Simplex Limit Sketch).
We can view as a limit sketch by declaring its marked cones to be those given by all inert maps to objects and from an object . Recall that the inert maps in are those injective maps which are surjective onto a segment of . These are precisely the injective maps generated by the edge face maps . Let denote the full subcategory of spanned by and . Then the cones are precisely those functors for each .
The models for this limit sketch in are those simplicial sets satisfying the Segal condition, which is to say the induced maps are isomorphisms. This recovers the essential image of the nerve .
This is a special case of the construction for an algebraic pattern , which is a small category with an orthogonal factorization system and a full subcategory of elementary objects. Then has the structure of a limit sketch with marked cones
for all .Note that if is a sketch and , then the slice category gets the structure of a sketch where a marked cone in determines a unique marked cone for each in using the natural isomorphism .Definition 3 (Bimodule in a Category ).
A bimodule in , for a category, is a model for the limit sketch in . Note that . This notation is used since we have an isomorphism . Recall that is the limit sketch whose objects are morphisms in (i.e. morphisms in ), and whose morphisms are commuting triangles. Note that this is precisely the opposite of the full subcategory , which under our previous isomorphism corresponds to profunctors such that is the singleton for all and . The marked cones are the compositesfor each simplex map , which we can think of as a primitive category bimodule.Note that an object of consists of the following data:
For each primitive category bimodule , an object For each map of category bimodules a morphism in For each primitive category bimodule , a limit cone which takes the form
so that the natural mapis an isomorphism in . In analogy with Segal simplicial sets, we can consider the primitive category bimodules as giving and as the domain and codomain of the bimodule, as the carrier, and and as objects of left and right actions, respectively. Explicitly, using the previous isomorphism, we get action maps<br>Note that when the isomorphisms in <a data-href="Loose Bimodules for (Augmented) Virtual Double Categories#^2094d3" href="research-projects/modules-of-systems/loose-bimodules-for-(augmented)-virtual-double-categories.html#^2094d3" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Loose Bimodules for (Augmented) Virtual Double Categories &gt; ^2094d3</a><a data-href="Loose Bimodules for (Augmented) Virtual Double Categories#^2094d3" href="research-projects/modules-of-systems/loose-bimodules-for-(augmented)-virtual-double-categories.html#^2094d3" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Loose Bimodules for (Augmented) Virtual Double Categories &gt; (1)</a> realize the pair as a strict category object internal to , and similarly for realizing as a category object internal to . A morphism in is then precisely a pair of functors of -internal categories and together with a morphism which respects the bi-category actions. ADD DETAILSIn particular, when , we recover our category of category bimodules.Theorem 4 (Slice Theorem for Sketches).
Given a limit sketch and a model , there is an isomorphism where is given the structure of a limit sketch by marking all lifts of marked cones in along the projection .
Proof.
Recall that for a copresheaf we have a sequence of equivalences<br>with the middle isomorphism coming from <a data-href="Fibrations in 2-Categories#^39a3bf" href="reading-notes/category-theory/higher-category-theory/fibrations/fibrations-in-2-categories.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Fibrations in 2-Categories &gt; ^39a3bf</a><a data-href="Fibrations in 2-Categories#^39a3bf" href="reading-notes/category-theory/higher-category-theory/fibrations/fibrations-in-2-categories.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Lemma 5 (Maps into Discrete Fibrations are Fibrations)</a>. The claim will now follow from a more general result for -sketches seen below.
□As a special case we obtain the equivalences:
Question
Why is it pseudo-bimodules in in the forest
To begin, recall that we have strict -functors and , with the second of which being fully-faithful PROVE THIS!!. In particular, via we can consider the walking loose arrow as a unital augmented virtual double category, while then realizes it also as a unital virtual double category.We will write for the unital VDC, while will denote the non-unital VDC with two objects and a sngle loose arrow between them. Recall we have a 2-comonad given by forgetting non-identity -ary cells, the coalgebra 2-category of which being . We will proceed using the language of AVDCs, specifying the difference between the general case and the case of diminished AVDCs to encapsulate the behaviour for ordinary VDCs.Definition 5 (Loose Bimodule on s).
A loose bimodule is an augmented virtual double functor into the unital walking loose arrow, where is an augmented virtual double category. We write for the slice -category of loose bimodules.
Diagrammatically we can depict this situation by a pair of pullbacks<br>Note that a loose bimodule in this sense agrees with a loose bimodule in the sense of <a data-href="Loose Bimodules and Their Construction - Scrap Notes#^4fe56e" href="reading-notes/category-theory/categorical-algebra/loose-bimodules-and-their-construction-scrap-notes.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">Loose Bimodules and Their Construction - Scrap Notes &gt; ^4fe56e</a><a data-href="Loose Bimodules and Their Construction - Scrap Notes#^4fe56e" href="reading-notes/category-theory/categorical-algebra/loose-bimodules-and-their-construction-scrap-notes.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Loose Bimodules and Their Construction - Scrap Notes &gt; ^4fe56e</a> when is representable, which is to say it's in the image of . We write and for the source and target of the augmented virtual loose bimodule. Recall that if is a (strict) double category, a loose bimodule is equivalent to a bimodule between monoids in , which consists of span of categories together with functors and which satisfy the bimodule axioms.On the other hand, when is an AVDC, a AVD-functor can be explicated as the following data:
An AVDC over and an AVDC over For each pair of objects and , a set of loose arrows , lying over the non-identity loose arrow in For each sequence of loose arrows in and in , along with tight arrows and , and loose arrows and , a collection of cells For pair of cells and , along with sequences of cells and , a composite cell
If is a diminished AVDC (i.e. an ordinary VDC) then the data is identical, with the one change that and are also diminished AVDCs (i.e. VDCs).Remark 6 (Underline Notation).
In the above work, a loose arrow with an underline, such as , represents to a sequence of loose arrows , while a cell with an underline, such as notates a sequence of - and -coary cells.
Question
Does match an existing structure?
If instead we consider AVD functors into the non-unital loose arrow, , the data is encapsulated as follows: -categories and over and , respectively
A category together with projections and to the underlying categories of the -categories
If denotes the set of cells in , then we have compatible action maps and which preserve sources and targets, and are strictly compatible under vertical composition in the sense that we have the equalities
<br>Note that if is a VDC then this forces that is a strict double category with no composable arrows, and this data is equivalent to a span of categories , with no additional data. Morphisms correspond to -functors together with a functor which is compatible with the under sources and targets, and equivariant with respect with respect to the actions on either side. Finally, -cells , given by (unital) oplax transformations (c.f. <a data-href="(Augmented) Virtual Double Categories and Generalized Multicategories#^8eb051" href="reading-notes/category-theory/double-categories/virtual-double-categories/(augmented)-virtual-double-categories-and-generalized-multicategories.html" class="original-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" style="display: none;">(Augmented) Virtual Double Categories and Generalized Multicategories &gt; ^8eb051</a><a data-href="(Augmented) Virtual Double Categories and Generalized Multicategories#^8eb051" href="reading-notes/category-theory/double-categories/virtual-double-categories/(augmented)-virtual-double-categories-and-generalized-multicategories.html" class="internal-link mathLink-internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Definition 5 (Lax AVD Transformation)</a>) correspond to lax transformations (because of the arrow convention above) together with for each object in the carrier, a cell , which form a natural family up to the action by the lax transformations, which is to sayQuestion
Is this a known structure?
In particular, it follows that is isomorphic to the -category whose objects are spans of categories, whose morphisms are maps of spans, and whose cells are compatible natural transformations between the morphisms in the maps of spans.<br>Recall that as in<a data-footref="3" href="#fn-2-476d6976e1bb0179" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[2]</a> a diminished AVDC (i.e. a VDC with whiskering) is equivalent to the data of a weak segal fibration for the algebraic pattern , which is to (i) admits cocartesian lifts of all inert morphisms (i.e. inclusions of sub-intervals, )
(ii) For each the functor induced by the cocartesian arrows is an equivalence of categories
(iii) For every morphism in and , composition with cocartesian morphisms over the inert morphisms gives an isomorphism
Explicate: For such a functor , the fiber is the tight category for the diminished AVDC, while the objects of are pro-arrows between objects in . By (ii), the objects of for is a sequence of pro-arrows . By (iii) a morphism lying over consists of a sequence of morphisms for each , which we picture as a cell with loose For example, is represented The data for such a loose bimodule is equivalent to the data of a twisted virtual double functor where is the pseudo-double category of categories, functors, profunctors, and profunctor transformations, interpreted as an augmented virtual double category via .Definition 7 (Twisted Virtual Double Functor).
For augmented virtual double categories , a twisted virtual double functor consists of the following data: An assignment on objects For each sequence of loose arrows a tight arrow which is functorial in the sense that For each tight arrow a profunctor , which is pseudo-functorial, which is to say that if is another tight arrow, then is given by composition of profunctors For each multi-cell , a transformation of profunctors
Add coherence details Case for VDCs (not AVDCs)
In our current situation the twisted virtual double functor is given by sending a pair of objects to the category with objects pairs of integers and sequences of tight morphisms, and with morphisms consisting of a
a poset map preserving top and bottom elements along with tight arrows and cellsComposition is given by composing poset maps and vertical composition of cells in .Sequences of loose arrows then induce functors given by pasting on identity cells, and this assignment is functorial with respect to concatenation of loose arrows in either variable. Explicitly, an object is sent to where denotes concatenation, and morphism below left, corresponding to a sequence of cells in , is sent to the concatenation below rightFor each pair of tight arrows , a profunctor given by the functor that sends pairs of objects and to the set of sequences of cells of the form to the set of maps, analogously to those in , but with tight source and tight target . The action on morphisms is given by vertical composition of such sequences of cells.Additionally, observe that a map of loose bimodules corresponds in this language to virtual double functors and together with a transformation of twisted virtual double functors from to given by the following data:
For each pair of objects , a functor For each pair of tight arrows , a profunctor transformation
given by a natural transformation which at is given by applying to the resulting cells in .Definition 8 (Transformation of Twisted Virtual Double Functors).
Given twisted virtual double functors , a transformation of twisted virtual double functors consists of A tight arrow for all objects A cell, as below, for all tight arrows , satisfying cellular naturality Finally, a virtual transformation over is equivalent to a modification between transformations of twisted virtual double functors. This consists of the following data:
Virtual transformations and For each pair of objects , a profunctor transformation
given by a natural transformationwhich at is given by pasting with the squares, for a loose morphism in .
TODO: Make this all explicit with diagram
Note: Technically only one loose arrow in a given sequence over the loose arrow can lie over (all other ones need to be in one of the fibers) - maybe use this in formalizing the above?
In this way we get a fully-faithful embeddingwhere on the right is the very large -category of locally small augmented virtual double categories.
TODO: Make this precise and formulate as a theorem
One of the essential benefits of this perspective is that we immediately obtain that the -categories involved are pro-arrow equipments. Indeed, has all restrictions, and these induce restrictions for TODO: Generalize this and state it as a proposition
In particular, any virtual double functor induces a 2-functor(pseudo-functor?)

We will write for the virtual equipment of augmented virtual double categories, tight -cells the virtual double functors between them, loose -cells the loose bimodules, and -cells of the form<br>Recall that in the sense of Leinster's Higher Operads, Higher Category Theory, the -category of pseudo-models of , which is given a -category structure by labelling its inerts as tight morphisms, is equivalent to the -category of unbiased weak double categories, -weak double functors, and tight transformations, with the tight morphisms being strict double functors.

TODO: Prove this claim
<br>In this subsection we discuss the non-existence of a natural associative composition for loose bimodules, with argument following that in<a data-footref="2" href="#fn-3-476d6976e1bb0179" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">[3]</a>. Let be the walking tight arrow, let be the walking tight composite, and let be the double category with two non-identity tight arrows and , and one non-identity loose arrow , with no non-identity cells. Using the barrel perspective on loose bimodules we then define bimodules , , and as inandTogether these loose bimodules can be represented by the diagramNow, towards a contradiction suppose we had a pseudo-associative notion of composition satisfying , Firstly, we define the VDC to be the sub-VDC of whose loose arrows consist of two-sided codiscrete cofibrations:VDC's internal to If we can make sense of VDCs internal to another category, is a virtual double 2-category?
Question
Is a pro-representable VDC?
Question
Is there a Grothendieck type construction for VD functors into ?
In addition to restriction of loose bimodules we can also consider collapse of loose bimodules. This is most easily defined in the context of two-sided double fibrations , where we simply post-compose by the unique map into the terminal double category. This construction defines loose bimodule , and in fact we get a cartesian 2-functorIn particular, we get induced 2-functorsWe also have the cartesian pseudo-functor , and hence the pseudo-functorsandWe then get a natural cartesian 2-functor such that the composite lands in , the full sub--category of symmetric monoidal loose right modules. Explicitly, this sends a symmetric monoidal loose bimodule to the nichewhere the left pseudo double-functor picks out the loose unit for the domain of the loose bimodule. In the language of two-sided double fibrations these two pseudo-functors on symmetric monoidal loose bimodules correspond to andIn particular, we see that we get a natural comparison map
Claim: This extends into a pseudo-natural transformation .
Recall that given a two-sided double fibration , the associated loose bimodule has for and those loose arrows which are objects of lying over and on the left and right. Thus, is given by the following data:
The terminal double category lying over and the double category lying over For each , and each pro-arrow in over the walking loose arrow, a pro-arrow , and for each cell in over the walking loose arrow below left, a cell in below right Composition on the left is strictly unital, while composition on the right is given as in using the description of loose arrows and cells as above.
Vertical composition of cells over the walking loose arrow is given as below:
using the vertical composition in .Example 9 (-categorical Example).
Let be a symmetric monoidal -category, so that we have the natural symmetric monoidal hom-two sided (discrete) fibration , which corresponds to the (discrete) bimodule , or the profunctor . The collapse corresponds to the (not necessarily discrete) two-sided fibration , or the profunctor , or the bimodule .
We now discuss a bimodule-oriented notion of loose adjunction.Definition 10 (Loose Adjunction).
Given virtual double functors , a lax loose adjunction between them consists of an adjunction of loose bimodules . <br>Libkind, S., Jaz Meyers, D., Carlson, K. (2025).
