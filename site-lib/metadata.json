Additionally, if , then can be identified with multiplication by the image of under the unit map , which we also denote by .We refer to an -category as -semiadditive if all -finite spaces are ambidextrous. For we recover the ordinary notion of a semiadditive -category. Note that if is a full subcategory of an -semiadditive -category, then if is either stable under -finite colimits or -finite limits, then it is stable under both, and it is -semiadditive itself.-Commutative Monoids\nLet . For , the -category of -commutative monoids in is given by When we write , and refer to its objects as -commutative monoids.\nIn the case , evaluating at , the unique object of , gives an equivalence .Explication ()\nAn object consists of an underlying space , together with a collection of coherent operations for summation of -finite families of points in it. Indeed, for , we have a canonical equivalence . Given in , the image of is the restriction , while the image of encodes integration along fibers .\nQuestion\nHow can we see the restriction and integration along fibers perspectives above?\nProp: Forgetful Functors between -Commutative Monoids Cats\nLet and let . The restriction along the inclusion functor induces a limit preserving functor Proof.\nIt suffices to prove that preserves -finite colimits. By the description of colimits in spans it suffices to prove that is stable under -finite colimits.\nQuestion\nHow can we see that has -finite colimits? If is an -finite diagram, then How do we know that is also -finite? We know that is -finite and that all fibers of the Kan fibration are -finite, so it is also an -finite map. Do -finite maps compose?\nThe following answers the above question:Prop: -finite Maps Compose\nIf and are -finite, then so is their composite .\nProof.\nTaking fibers, it suffices to show that if is an -finite map with an -finite space, then is also -finite. For each point , we have a homotopy fiber sequence where is also -finite, by definition of -finite maps. Thus, looking at the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for each , we see that is also -truncated, has finitely many path components, and has all homotopy groups begin finite, completing the proof.\nWe extend to by defining for the -categorywith limit computed in . This is equivalent toConsequently, when is presentable, is presentable for all , and can then be described as a colimit of in :Lemma: as Colimit in For , the forgetful functors admit left adjoints, and the colimit of the sequence in is . In particular, is presentable.\nThe mapping spaces between two objects in an -semiadditive -category have a canonical -commutative monoid structure.Prop: Universality of Let . For every and , post-composition with evaluation at induces an equivalence of -categories As a consequence, for each -semiadditive -category we have a unique lift of the Yoneda embedding to a -enriched Yoneda embedding:Corollary: -enriched Yoneda\nLet .

We have the following universal example of an -semiadditive -category:Universal Case\nFor the symmetric monoidal -category of spans is the universal -semiadditive -category. For every , we have Note that is the set of isomorphism classes of -finite spaces with semiring structure given by Similarly, is the universal presentable -semiadditive -category. The Yoneda embedding induces a fully-faithful -semiadditive symmetric monoidal functor taking an -finite space to the free -commutative monoid on .\nHomotopy Cardinality\nFor a -finite space , the homotopy cardinality of is the rational number We say an -category is semirational if it is -semiadditive (i.e. -finite spaces are -ambidextrous, which are contractible, empty, and discrete spaces) and for each , multiplication by is invertible in (e.g. or ). Here multiplication by on an object is given by the cardinality , which is the composite A semirational -category which admits all -finite colimits is automatically -semiadditive, and for every -finite space , we have that its cardinality is its homotopy cardinality: This comes from the fact that the cardinality is additive, and for every fiber sequence of -finite spaces where is connected, . In Chromatic homotopy theory we often come across examples of -semiadditive -categories of higher height. For a given prime , and , let be the Morava -theory spectrum of height at the prime . We have that the localizations and are -semiadditive. For , , and the cardinalities recover the homotopy cardinality. Similarly, since is -local for all , if is a -finite space whose homotopy groups have cardinality prime to , then the -local cardinality of coincides with the homotopy cardinality for all by the previous example. However, this does not hold in general for -finite spaces whose cardinality is not prime to .To study the -local cardinalities of -finite spaces, it is useful to consider their image in Morava -theory. For , let be the Morava -theory associated with some formal group of height over , viewed as an object of . In particular, we have a (non-canonical) isomorphismChromatic Cardinality\nThe -category is -semiadditive by Theorem 5.3.1 in6, and hence we can consider cardinalities of -finite spaces in . The -typical height cardinality of a -finite space is defined to be For we can identify with , and so can recover the homotopy cardinality. For , let be the -adic free loop space of . It turns out that belongs to the subring and satisfies . Applying this inductively we see that for the -typical height cardinality in terms of the homotopy cardinality. If is a -space, then coincides with the ordinary loop space.\nQuestion\nHow can we show that when is a -space? Hint: First consider the universal examples . The following gives another family of examples of higher semiadditive -categories:Prop: is -semiadditive\nFor every the -category is -semiadditive.\nCategorical Cardinality\nLet and let . For every -finite space , the -semiadditive structure of gives rise to a functor . When , is given by taking the constant colimit on . Since preserves limits, and hence is -semiadditive, the same claim holds for .\nConversely, the -semiadditive structure on is given by taking limits of constant diagrams.(co)Cartesian -commutative Monoid Structure\nFor , since is freely generated from a point under -finite colimits, we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cocartesian structure. Dually, for , we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cartesian structure.\nThe full subcategory is closed under colimits, and in particular is -semiadditive, since the inclusion admits the right adjoint .We will explore the notion of semiadditive height, as well as its relation to other classical notions of height. The definition of height will depend on a choice of a prime , and a -typical version of -semiadditivity where we use -finite -spaces rather than all -finite spaces. -Spaces\nRecall that a space is a -space if and only if all its homotopy groups are -torsion (i.e. for each , and each , there exists such that ). When has finite homotopy groups, this implies that they are -groups (i.e. their order is a power of ).\n-Typical Semiadditivity\nLet be a prime and . We say that An -category is -typically -semiadditive if all -finite -spaces are -ambidextrous.\nA functor between such is -typically -semadditive if it preserves all -finite -space colimits (or equivalently limits).\nAn -monoidal -category for an -operad is -typically -semiadditively -monoidal if it is -typically -semiadditive and is compatible with -finite -space colimits (equivalently limits). Let denote the sub--category of -typically -semiadditive -categories and -typically -semiadditive functors.Prop: -Typical -Semiadditivity from Building Blocks\nLet . (1) An -category is -typically -semiadditive if and only if is -ambidextrous for all (2) For , a -semiadditive functor is -typically -semiadditive if and only if it preserves -(co)limits for all . Proof.\n(1) Since is an -finite -space for all , the only if direction is definitional. Conversely, let be an -finite -space. Since is -semiadditive, we are reduced to the case that is connected. Indeed, otherwise for connected -finite -spaces. Thenand can be given by and by iterating Kan extensions, so as is -semiadditive it suffices that the norm maps are equivalences.Now, since is connected, the Postnikov tower of can be refined to a tower of principal fibrationssuch that the fiber of each is of the form for some , since all connected -finite -spaces are -nilpotent.Since we can iterate Kan extensions, to show is -ambidextrous it suffices to show each is -ambidextrous, and since -ambidexterity is a fiber-wise condition, this follows from the fact that is -ambidextrous.(2) Analogously to (1), we can reduce to connected -finite -spaces, at which point we can take a tower of principal fibrations, so that commuting with -(co)limits follows from commuting with -(co)limits, which are equivalent to commuting with fiber-wise indexed (co)limits, i.e. -(co)limits.\nFor a -typical -semiadditive -category , the cardinalities for will play an important role in our definition of semiadditive height. The motivating example to consider in what follows is the following:-modules of -local Spectra\nFor , we have for all , where the case is interpreted using .\nWe now move to defining semiadditive height. This relies on the following notion of divisibility and completeness with respect to natural endomorphisms of the identity.Divisibility and Completeness\nLet and let be a natural endomorphism. An object is called: -divisible if is invertible\n-complete if for all -divisible We suggestively write for the full subcategories spanned by the -divisible and -complete objects, respectively.Semiadditive Height of Objects\nLet be a -typical -semiadditive -category and let . We define the -typical semiadditive height of as follows for : (1) We say if is -divisible\n(2) We say if is -complete\n(3) We say if and . Warning\nWhen is not -semiadditive, the notion of semiadditive height is not well-defined for all objects in . Indeed, we can only test an objects height being or if is to the semiadditivity of , so we can have objects which have height , and not have a finite defined height.\nIn particular, the statements and signify a certain property that satisfies, and is in general not a well-defined number which can be compared with .\nFor which is -semiadditive we write if and only if for all . By convention for all , and or if and only if .Height Let be a -semiadditive -category. Then an object is of height if and only if , the map obtained by is an equivalence, and of height if it is -complete.\nThe next result helps justify the inequality notation.Prop: Inequalities of Height\nLet be a -typical -semiadditive -category and let be some integers. Then for (1) If then (2) If then Proof.\nFor (1) it suffices by iterating that if for some , then .

Another motivation for this approach comes from the observation that a continuous map of spaces induces a geometric morphism of -topoi. In this way, such a morphism allows us to consider as a -category which carries the information of the original sheaf topos on along with topological properties of the continuous map inducing it.Throughout will be an -topos, which is to say a left exact and accessible localization of a presheaf -category for some small -category , where is the -category of -groupoids.There are three main presentations of -categories internal to the -topos :\nThe simplicial perspective\nThe sheaf perspective\nThe fibered perspective\nWe write for the -spine, which can be viewed as a simplicial -groupoid , and we write for the walking equivalence. We will often use the algebraic morphism in the adjunction to identify simplicial -groupoids, such as these, with simplicial objects in .-category (Simplicial Definition)\nA -category is a simplicial object that is internally local with respect to (Segal conditions) and (univalence). We write for the full subcategory spanned by -categories. A -groupoid is a simplicial object which is internally local with respect to . We write for the full subcategory spanned by -groupoids.\nThe -groupoids are precisely the essential image of the diagonal embedding so that . The statement that is internally local with respect to a certain morphism in means that the canonical map is internally right orthogonal to the morphisms, or equivalently that the induced mapis an equivalence. The inclusion preserves filtered colimits and admits a left adjoint preserving finite products. In particular, is presentable and an exponential ideal in , so in particular is cartesian closed. We can define bifunctors\n(Functor -category) (Powering) (Tensoring) which fit into 2-variable adjunctions In particular, evaluating the left equivalence at the terminal -category we have , so that gives rise to a -enrichment of , or in other words an -categorical enhancement.\nUsing our previously defined bifunctor, we have a natural fully-faithful embedding which factors through an equivalenceThus, -categories are equivalent to sheaves of -categories . When is a copre-sheaf -topos, we have a natural equivalenceThus, the current perspective generalizes the notion of paramaterized -categories. Additionally, via the un/straightening correspondence we obtain an embedding .For a -category and , we write for the -category of local sections over , and write for the restriction along a map in . One can also interpret as the complete Segal space whose space of -morphisms is given by the -groupoid .For a geometric morphism with left adjoint , is given by restriction along , while is given by left Kan extension along . If admits a further left adjoint , then this is just precomposition with .Explication: Objects and Morphisms in -Categories\nUsing the two-variable adjunctions introduced previously, one obtains equivalences for all , , and (with the diagonal embedding left implicit). Combining this with a previous remark we see that Let's see some examples in the sheaf perspective:-groupoid\nEvery object of defines a -category via the Yoneda embedding The -categories of this form are called -groupoids.\nThe -category of -groupoids\nSince is a topos, the functor associated to the cartesian fibration (i.e. ) preserves limits and thus defines a -category denoted by , and refer to it as the -category of -groupoids.\nLet's now move to describing internal (co)limits in the parameterized setting.-colimits\nLet be an -category and let be a class of morphisms in closed under base change (i.e. base-changes of morphisms in exist and have output again in ). Given a functor , we say that admits -colimits or is -cocomplete if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) For every in , the functor admits a left adjoint <br>(2) For every pullback square in <img src=\"images/svg-cache/232d8cfa02809dc47e80606783a00644.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nwith , the Beck-Chevalley transformation of functors is an equivalence.\nExplication\nIf is terminal, then the functor having a left adjoint is analogous to the diagonal having a left adjoint, which occurs precisely when has -shaped colimits. In general we can think of as a kind of left Kan extension. The Beck-Chevalley transformation then says that left Kan extensions formed in this way are preserved under base-change.\nDually, if has a right adjoint such that the corresponding Beck-Chevalley transformations are equivalences, then we say admits -limits.Often we will add the assumption that is an -topos, and that the class in is local in the sense that a morphism is in whenever there exists an effective epimorphism in such that each of the base change maps is in .Preserving -colimits\nLet be -cocomplete. A natural transformation is said to preserve -colimits if for every morphism in the Beck-Chevalley map is an equivalence (we also say is -cocontinuous).\nExample: Base Case\nWhen , global sections defines an equivalence , with inverse given by sending to . For , a cat then has -colimits if and only if we can perform left Kan extension for space-indexed functors into along morphisms in .\nIn addition to groupoid indexed colimits defined in this fashion, we will also be interested in fiberwise colimits:Fiberwise Colimits\nLet be a (non-parameterized) -category. We say that a -category has fiberwise -shaped colimits if the category has -shaped colimits for every and the restriction functor preserves -shaped colimits for each in .\nWe say a functor of -categories with fiberwise -shaped colimits preserves fiberwise -shaped colimits if it preserves -shaped colimits pointwise.<br>Combining these notions we will say a -category is cocomplete if it is -cocomplete in the parameterized sense and moeover fiberwise cocomplete. Analogously to the classical theory, if is a cocomplete -category, then the inclusion of constant diagrams has a left adjoint for every and every small -category (c.f. Corollary 5.4.7 of<a data-footref=\"4\" href=\"#fn-4-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4-1]</a>).Definition: Symmetric Monoidal -category\nA symmetric monoidal -category is a commutative monoid in the -category , or equivalently, a limit-preserving functor .\nFor we denote the tensor product and monoidal unit of by and , respectively.Definition: Presentable -Categories\nA -category is called fiberwise presentable if it factors (necessarily uniquely) through the subcategory of presentable -categories and colimit preserving functors. We say is presentable if it is fiberwise presentable and additionally satisfies the following two conditions: (1) (Left Adjoints) For all in , the restriction has left adjoint (2) (Left Base Change) For every , with pullback cospan , the Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence. If are presentable -categories, we say -functor preserves (parameterized) colimits if the following two properties are satisfied:\n(1) For every , the functor preserves small colimits;\n(2) For every in , the Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence\nNote that in the left Base change condition, passing to right adjoints gives that the other Beck-Chevalley transformation is also an equivalence by uniqueness of adjoints and the fact that and . In fact, for a commuting diagram<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/33625e9f751fe1d8d843e7a2db84e774.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">with the morphisms fitting into adjoint triples , etc., the Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence if and only if the Beck-Chevalley transformationis an equivalence, since and .-Parameterized Animae\nThe target functor is a cartesian fibration, so by (HTT, Theorem 6.1.3.9) is classified by a limit-preserving functor The pullback functors have left adjoints which satisfy the Beck-Chevalley condition, so is a presentable -category, called the -category of -groupoids.\n<br>As with un-parameterized presentable -categories, presentable -categories have a natural tensor product, characterized by the fact that it represents bi-cocontinuous -functors (c.f.<a data-footref=\"6\" href=\"#fn-6-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[6-1]</a>, Section 8.2). This gives the structure of a symmetric monoidal -category whose monoidal unit is . In particular, the classical formula carries over to giveThe universal property satisfied by this parameterized monoidal structure can be expressed by the equivalencewhich in particular implies that preserves colimits.Presentably Symmetric Monoidal -Category\nA presentably symmetric monoidal -category is a commutative algebra object in the symmetric monoidal -category .\nNote that we have an embedding so that a symmetric monoidal -category is presentably symmetric monoidal if and only if it is presentable, and the tensor product -functor is bi-cocontinuous. This can be expressed by the following two non-parameterized conditions:\n(Fiberwise presentably symmetric monoidal) For each , the tensor product functor is bi-cocontinuous\n(Left Projection Formula) For each in and all objects and , the exchange morphism is an equivalence\nEquivalently, this can be expressed as a limit-preserving functor such that the symmetric monoidal restriction functors admit left adjoints that satisfy base change and satisfy the left projection formula.To continue the preliminaries needed for twisted ambidexterity, the next step is to understand the algebra and module theory associated to the symmetric monoidal -category . Before diving into this material we will review some basic aspects of the theory of -operads, and the theory algebras over algebraic patterns more generally. <br>Bastiaan Cnossen. “Twisted Ambidexterity in Equivariant Homotopy Theory: Two Approaches.” Phd, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, 2024. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11811/11281\" target=\"_self\">https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11811/11281</a>.<a href=\"#fnref-1-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Cnossen, Bastiaan, Tobias Lenz, and Sil Linskens. “Parametrized (Higher) Semiadditivity and the Universality of Spans.” arXiv:2403.07676.

For we write for the full subcategory spanned by -finite spaces.\n-space, for a prime, if all the homotopy groups of are -groups. Given an -category , For every map of spaces , we write for the pullback functor and and for the left and right adjoints of (i.e. given by left and right Kan extension, respectively), whenever they exist\nUnder the equivalence , we will identify a space with its map to the terminal object, so that above we would write instead of for , and similarly for the others\nFor each , we write , and write for the co-unit (called the fold). Similarly, we write and write for the unit (called the diagonal) Given a map of spaces , and , we write for the homotopy fiber of over . We say that: An -category admits -limits (resp. -colimits) if it admits all limits (resp. colimits) of shape for all A functor preserves -limits (resp. preserves -colimits) if it preserves all limits (resp. colimits) of shape for all For every -finite (co)limits refer to (co)limits indexed by an -finite space\nWe write (resp. ) for the subcategory spanned by -categories admitting -finite colimits (resp. limits) and functors preserving them.\nFor (resp. ) We wrote (resp. ) for the full subcategory of spanned by -finite colimit (resp. limit) preserving functors\nWe write for the subcategory spanned by the -semiadditive -categories and -semiadditive (i.e. -finite colimit preserving) functors.\nGiven an -operad , we say is compatible with -indexed colimits for some collection of -categories if the underlying -category admits -indexed colimits and every tensor operation of preserves -indexed colimits in each variable\nAn -semiadditively -monoidal -category is an -monoidal -semiadditive -category which is compatible with -finite colimits Q. What does this mean?\nIf is a monoidal -category and is an -category enriched in , we write for the -mapping object of . When is closed, we write for . For every -category we write . The importance of -finite maps and spaces lies in their use as indexing -categories for diagrams that we are interested in comparing limits and colimits of. Specifically, the in -semiadditivity indicates the size of the -finite spaces for which we have norm mapswhich are equivalences. Let's begin with the basic notion of ambidexterity in chromatic homotopy theory.Ambidexterity of -finite Maps\nLet . A -finite map is called: weakly -ambidextrous if it is an equivalence, or is -ambidextrous\n-ambidextrous if it is weakly -ambidextrous, admits all -limits and -colimits, and the norm map is an equivalence. A -finite map, i.e. an equivalence, is always -ambidextrous. If is -finite, then the diagonalis -finite and the ambidexterity of allows in turn the definition of .The property of being -ambidextrous is preserved by pullbacks and determined by its fibers. Since the fibers of the diagonal are path spaces of , is weakly -ambidextrous if and only if the path spaces of are -ambidextrous. This begins the inductive construction since the path-space reduces from an -finite space to an -finite space.Prop: Characterization of -Ambidextrous Morphism\nLet be an -category and let be a -finite map. The map is -ambidextrous if and only if the following hold: is weakly -ambidextrous admits all -limits and -colimits\nEither preserves all -colimits or preserves all -limits. Proof Idea.\nFrom the discussion above, we can assume wlog that . The forward implication is immediate due to the norm equivalence, so it suffices to show that if (1)-(3) hold, then the norm map is an equivalence. ***Prop: Closure of Ambidexterity under -category constructions\nLet be an -category and let be a -finite -ambidextrous space. The space is also -ambidextrous for (1) (2) for an -category\n(3) containing the final object and closed under -limits for all and (4) containing the initial object and closed under -colimits for all and . Note: Here is the -fold based loop space at .The first two properties are classical, while the last two are dual and follow from the inductive construction of norm maps.Important\nThe main feature of ambidexterity is that it allows us to integrate families of morphisms in . That is, given a -ambidextrous map and , we have a map which can be given by the composite When we can think of an element of as a map , and as the sum of over points of . Explicitly, the identification of mapping spaces comes from the equivalences Intuition for Induction: For a space and a diagram , to specify a norm map is to specify a homotopy coherently compatible collection of morphisms , for . always provides a family of candidates for these maps, , but a-priori there is no coherent choice for them which can be made. But, if we can integrate over the spaces , we can just takeWhen is constant on some object , then the Norm map is the same as a map of spaces , where the above construction specializes to .Important\nThe initial claim comes from the natural equivalences where is the whiskering of , while is the whiskering of . Thus, we have a natural equivalence Thus, the data of a map is equivalent to the data of a map of simplicial sets such that and .\nFurther, in the case when is the constant functor at some . In this case, the data of a map is equivalent to the data of a map of simplicial sets such that . A natural family of such transformations is then a map of simplicial sets such that .\nMore generally, if has all -shaped (co)limits, so that we have functors , then the natural equivalences we want are given by using adjoints and (co)continuity of the diagonal:Thus, a family of norms is equivalent to a natural transformation .Similarly, if has all -shaped (co)limits for , so that exist, then we have natural maps","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Introduction/Motivation","level":2,"id":"Introduction/Motivation_0"},{"heading":"Semiadditivity","level":2,"id":"Semiadditivity_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"board-talks/ambidexterity-seminar/introduction-to-semiadditivity.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1757919400727,"modifiedTime":1759803333067,"sourceSize":48291,"sourcePath":"Board Talks/Ambidexterity Seminar/Introduction to Semiadditivity.md","exportPath":"board-talks/ambidexterity-seminar/introduction-to-semiadditivity.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":4,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"board-talks/ambidexterity-seminar/reading-plan-for-ambidexterity-seminar-(fall-2025).html":{"title":"Reading Plan for Ambidexterity Seminar (Fall 2025)","icon":"","description":"We will be starting with section 2 of Shachar et al.'s paper on Ambidexterity and Height<a data-footref=\"11\" href=\"#fn-1-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a>, before moving into the initial main reference, which will be the first part of Bastiaan Cnossen's thesis<a data-footref=\"1\" href=\"#fn-2-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>, with other references/possible directions being Hilman, Kirstein, and Kremer's generalization of twisted ambidexterity in<a data-footref=\"8\" href=\"#fn-3-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[3]</a>, as well as applications of ordinary ambidexterity to chromatic homotopy theory in<a data-footref=\"10\" href=\"#fn-4-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>.

However, structures such as -categories, or more generally bicategories (and their higher dimensional analogues), are often insufficient for encoding a number of important abstract constructions prevalent in category theory. Although notions such as adjunctions and equivalences can be defined purely algebraically internal to any bicategory, the naive definition of fully-faithfulness and of Kan extensions often fails to encapsulate the right properties in enriched settings. This failure stems from the inability to discuss representability, or equivalently yoneda constructions, internal to a general bicategory.\nIn this talk we will provide a brief introduction to the framework of formal category theory via pro-arrow equipments which fixes this issue. After this brief introduction we will explore how this work generalizes to the construction of a formal theory of -categories due to Riehl and Verity (with further recent work by Ruit) which provides a suitable definition of Kan extensions internal to an arbitrary -cosmos (and hence any well-behaved model of -categories).\nThis note accompanies a brief talk on the formal theory of -category theory at the UIUC Graduate Homotopy Theory Seminar, motivated primarily by the work of Riehl and Verity on -cosmoi in 24 and 5, as well as the classical theory of formal category theory via pro-arrow equipments discussed by Verity in6 with additional extensions by Shulman in3. Although this note does not cover the theory of pro-arrow equipments internal to -categories, as constructed by Ruit in1, Ruit's work is a large motivator for the speaker's interest in this area.As discussed at length in a number of the above sources, one of the main goals of formal category theory is to be able to abstract and encapsulate the essential aspects of category theory in its many guises, such as enriched category theory and fibrant category theory. A first attempt at this can be seen in the structure of -categories which are rich enough to formalize notions of adjunctions and equivalences. However, it was found that such structures alone were insufficient for the development of a great number of important categorical concepts and tools. For instance, one can formulate a definition of Kan extensions internal to a -category, but this would only produce the naive definition of Kan extensions rather than the more prolific and useful notion of pointwise Kan extensions. Similarly, although one can attempt to representably define fully-faithfulness of functors, often this will produce the wrong notion, for example when considering enriched concepts.But why should we care about pointwise Kan extensions over the naive notion that can be defined internal to any -category? Some motivation from homotopy theory is that pointwise Kan extensions are needed to obtain functorial derived functors, while the result that Quillen adjunctions descend to adjunctions on the level of homotopy categories also relies on this pointwise (or more strictly absolute) notion of Kan extensions.It turns out that the thing missing from these structures is exactly a theory which can internally discuss the notion of representability and yoneda embeddings. Generalizing, one can ask that we can encapsulate a suitable notion of profunctors , which are classically represented by bifunctors in ordinary category theory, or in a -enriched context. The canonical example of such a functor (resp. -functor) is given by the hom-bifunctor\nfor a category , which is adjoint to the yoneda embedding . In this note we aim to provide a brief intuition for structures that behave like profunctors more generally, and how we can extend them to -categorical contexts.Pro-arrow equipments are an additional structure on a bicategory introduced by Wood, and studied further by Verity in6, in order to encapsulate the structure of profunctors present in the canonical bicategory .Equipments on Bicategories\nAn equipment on a bicategory consists of another bicategory along with an identity on objects bifunctor\nsuch that for any -cell in , admits a right adjoint in . An equipment is called a pro-arrow equipment if in addition is locally fully faithful.\nHowever, we will not explore these definitions, as given here, much further in this note, instead preferring Verity's reformulation in terms of the theory of double categories which we now briefly review. For this perspective we will primarily follow Shulman's exposition in3, where he refers to these structures as framed bicategories. These structures have important applications outside of just the formal theory of category theory, such as in the study of parametrized spectra and in our -categorical setting to come, parametrized -categories which provide a way of studying enriched -categories.As in3 and4 we will be restricting to what in double-categorical literature is often referred to as pseudo double categories when speaking of double categories in this note. Intuitively, one can think of a double category as a pair of a vertical category and a horizontal category with squares relating their morphisms such that the composition in the horizontal category need not be strict (and as we will see later with virtual double categories, may not even be defined).Double Category\nA double category is an internal category object in :\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/30a391227429ec19f371004b2a58490c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nequipped with natural isomorphisms\nsatisfying appropriate coherence diagrams, and which are identities under whiskering with or .\nHere we write in diagrammatic ordering, suggesting our emphasis on the perspective that pro-arrows in a double category represent modules.<br>Double Category of Squares in a -category\nLet be a -category. Then we have a natural double category whose category is the underlying category of , and whose category has as objects -cells in and as morphisms squares\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/a1397f558f1e936317a5a39db8998eec.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nHorizontal and vertical composition is given by pasting -cells.\n<br>Double Category of Modules\nLet be the double category with , the category of (unital) rings, and the category with objects bimodules and morphisms bimodule homomorphisms.

Horizontal composition on profunctors is given by the co-end formula\nwhere on the right is standard tensor on given by cartesian product, or more general for , is the chosen tensor in .\nAn important piece in the theory of pro-arrow equipments, especially when we inevitably move on to the theory of equipments as a descriptor for modules between -categories, is the notion of fibered categories. Briefly, a Grothendieck fibration between categories is a functor such that for every and every morphism in , there exists a lift making the diagram<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/a0328383eeebc039fc49147bc28cd0cc.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">a pullback in . Intuitively this says that universally lifts factorizations through for maps comin from . Dually, an opfibration is a functor such that for every and in , there exists a lift making the diagram<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/c5b1fafbf3c4c10e3c9c09a231a65c09.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">a pullback in .Two important results for fibrations which are relevant to this note are their correspondence to pseudo-functors under the Grothendieck construction and the relation between fibrations and op-fibrations in terms of adjunctions in the total category.Theorem: Grothendieck Construction [Shu,3.8]\nGiven a category , we have an equivalence\nwhere the category on the left has as objects Grothendieck fibrations and as morphisms maps in the slice which preserve cartesian morphisms, and the category on the right has as objects pseudo-functors and as morphisms strong transformations, where is viewed as a discrete bicategory.\nAdjoint Relation Between Fibrations and Op-Fibrations [Shu,3.9]\nA fibration is an opfibration if and only if for every in , the natural functor has a left adjoint .\nProof.\nLet be a map in . Note that by the classification of cartesian lifts applied to identity fillings, we have a natural bijection between maps in lying over and maps in . On the other hand, the dual property for opcartesian lifts gives a bijection between maps over and maps in . In other words, we have the natural bijection\nso the existence of opcartesian lifts is equivalent to the existence of right adjoints, and vice-versa if we start with an opfibration. *** In addition to the existence of pro-arrows, which are our horizontals arrows in any double category, we want suitable assumptions on our double categories so that they behave like profunctors in order to encapsulate an appropriate theory of kan extensions. This behaviour is encapsulated in the language of fibrations reviewed above.Pro-arrow Equipment\nA double category is said to be a pro-arrow equipment on is a bifibration.\nThis structure equivalently encapsulates the idea of base change, which is terminology of bimodules instead of pro-arrows when talking about double categories, and in particular pro-arrow equipments. Let's unpack what it means for to be a bifibration. Since such a functor being a bifibration is equivalent to it being a fibration or a opfibration (c.f. [Shu,4.1]) we'll just consider the case of fibration. Explicitly we're saying that any cup<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/5af4c9e20da1f6eaa5dd6a6d5902850a.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">can be universally filled to a square<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/992ed02e696f537977636947ef098ba3.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">in the sense that any rectangle uniquely factors through it:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/170dce4cff2d7097a508c81b97a85dc2.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">This structure is equivalent to the existence of companions and conjoints for all vertical morphisms in the double category (c.f.

Explicitly, for is a vertical morphism, then , where is the identity at in under horizontal composition. Similarly, . Going the other way, a filling as above the definition can be precisely obtained from companions and conjoints as the composite, or tensor, , while the dual filling for opfibrations, , is given by . These are the structures that will allow us to formalize and generalize weighted colimits, fully-faithfulness, and (pointwise) Kan extensions internally to a pro-arrow equipment.Double Category of Modules is a pro-arrow equipment, where for ring homomorphisms and as well as a bimodule , is exactly the bimodule obtained by restriction. Equivalently, . The previous formulas also tells us that this forces for a bimodule that\nwhich is the usual base-change formula for bimodules.\nDouble Category of Profunctors is a pro-arrow equipment where for functors and , and a profunctor , its pullback is given by the composite\nOn the other hand, if is another profunctor, then is given by pointwise left Kan extension: Observe that if is any functor, then the profunctor under adjunction corresponds to a functor given by sending to .

By the universal property of this corresponds to an accessible functor\nand as the reader might observe, this gives us an adjoint pair . This observation is actually a general phenomenon of pro-arrow equipments.Adjoint Pair of Pro-arrows [Shu, 5.3]\nIf is a vertical arrow in a pro-arrow equipment , then internal to the horizontal bicategory .\nProof.\nWe can explicit construct the unit and co-unit of this adjunction as the composites<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/eaa254f8db13993d9a08958f7b615031.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">with the triangle identities following from the defining identities for conjoints and companions. *** This can be viewed as a special case of the following more general result.Preservation of Adjoint Pairs under Base Change\nLet be an adjoint pair in , with and . If and are vertical morphisms, then .\nProof.\nObserve that\nso we have the composite<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/3bb02aa311b80e1476446c5c79275ef1.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">where the result now follows from the fact that adjoints compose in an arbitrary bicategory. *** However, if we go with the original philosophy of pro-arrow equipments we should be thinking of the horizontal arrows as a tool for doing category theory in the -category . A key result in this direction is the following lemma describing how we can translate between horizontal and vertical composites using companions and conjoints.<br>Central Lemma\nGiven a pro-arrow equipment , there is a natural bijection between squares of the following forms\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/1d0305702aa561a2d1c4fa997f67f023.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nThis equivalence is given by pasting with the squares defining companions and conjoints. This immediately allows us to realize an adjunction in the vertical -category , which takes the form<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/feef4257753b47f40f611cbee5ddc43c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">can equivalently be phrased as squares<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/f3cd85588d98af73893ca2bdda0c61a6.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">Using our analogy with profunctors we can think of as representing the hom , while as . Tracing through how the triangle identities transform shows that we exactly obtain squares which are vertical isomorphisms, given a formal correspondence between internal and hom characterizations of adjunctions.With this analogy in mind we can give the following definition of fully-faithfulness:<br>Fully-Faithful Vertical Morphism in Pro-arrow Equipment\nA vertical morphism in a pro-arrow equipment is said to be fully-faithful if and only if the canonical square\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/37ccdbbdf071e29c99afad39094b66ce.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nis an isomorphism in .\nFinally, before moving into our -categorical story lets discuss the main advertised benefit of the use of pro-arrow equipments in formal category theory: the ability to describe the right kind of Kan extensions. We will do this through the language of weighted (co)limits. In the context of pro-arrow equipments the pro-arrows serve as our weights, while the vertical arrows are what we're taking (co)limits of. In order to define this for convenience we could require more structure on our double category , which classically corresponds to the requirement that we have enough (right) extensions and lifts. Explicitly, we may require that the bicategory is closed, which is to say its composition sits in a triple of adjunctions\nThe first equivalence is the statement that we have enough right lifts while the equivalence with the second hom is the statement that we have enough right extensions. General properties of adjoints then imply the for , , and ,\nHowever, we can also define it in terms of the universal property for local right extensions and lifts.<br>Weighted (co)limits in a Pro-arrow Equipment\nLet and be a vertical and horizontal arrow in a pro-arrow equipment . A vertical arrow is a -weighted colimit of if its conjoint represents -cones under , or in other words is a right lifting of the conjoint along . Explicitly, this means that we have a square such that any square\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/00e5ffc66a15c2a0b5e1f8fefedffca7.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nfactors through via a square . In taking with hom object the monoidal unit, we obtain the usual definition of a weighted colimit in a -category for a -diagram . Indeed, in this case a weight is the same as a -functor , while the universal property says that we have a natural isomorphism\nWe can finally give the right definition of (pointwise) left and right Kan extensions in this context.Pointwise Kan Extension\nIf and are vertical arrows in , then the pointwise left Kan extension of along , if it exists, is the colimit of weighted by the conjoint .\nLet's unpack this definition in the context of our above work. Explicitly, this says that a pointwise left Kan extension of along should be a vertical arrow together with a universal square<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/87e039abdfa98ff7d238709743d25390.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\"><br>Using <a data-href=\"An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules#^9faa11\" href=\"board-talks/topology-seminar/an-introduction-to-formal-(infinity-)category-theory-via-modules.html#^9faa11\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules &gt; ^9faa11</a><a data-href=\"An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules#^9faa11\" href=\"board-talks/topology-seminar/an-introduction-to-formal-(infinity-)category-theory-via-modules.html#^9faa11\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules &gt; ^9faa11</a> we can rephrase this as a square<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/40e9067bde50a6da74c38562706f3995.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which is the usual description of a left Kan extension, except now the weighted colimit requirement has encoded the correct universal property to ensure that this Kan extension is pointwise.Explicitly, if with a complete and cocomplete monoidal closed category, then for -functors and , a left Kan extension of along (if it exists) is a -functor together with a universal -natural transformation\nor after adjunction, since is (co)complete and closed, a -natural isomorphism\nwhich is the standard definition of a -enriched pointwise left Kan extension.Main takeaway: In order to define a formal notion of weighted colimits, fully-faithfulness, or pointwise Kan extensions, one needs a formal theory encoding representability internal to your structure.Now that we're more familiar with the classical theory of formal category theory in terms of pro-arrow equipments we can move on to the formal category theory of -categories. In this section we will begin by introducing the notion -cosmos due to Riehl and Verity7 before introducing the necessary language of (co)cartesian fibrations5 in order to introduce modules between -categories4. Finally, we will conclude with a brief discussion of how these modules between -categories let us encode Kan extensions in -cosmoi.This note will contain only details of relevance and interest to the current topic on -cosmoi. For a more complete description we refer to Riehl and Verity's text7. We will also not delve into the details of the quasi-categorical theory or provide definitions of such concepts here.Morally -cosmoi aim to describe the mathematical universe in which -categories live, rather than prescribing to a particular model of -categories. To those familiar with the model category literature you may notice that -cosmoi can be realized as a kind of enriched category of fibrant objects.-Cosmos\nAn -cosmos is a category enriched over the full subcategory of quasi-categories, together with a class of morphisms called isofibrations (denoted ) such that (Completeness) in the simplicially enriched sense possesses a terminal object,\nsmall products,\npullbacks of isofibrations,\nlimits of countable towers of isofibrations,\ncotensors with simplicial sets (Isofibrations) The class of isofibrations contains all isomorphisms and all maps (i.e. all objects are fibrant), while being closed under: composition,\nproduct,\npullback,\ninverse limits of towers, and\nLeibniz cotensors with monomorphisms of simplicial sets (i.e. mimicking the notion of a closed model structure), Isofibrations are also representably defined in the sense that if is an isofibration and is any object,\nis an isofibration of quasi-categories.\nMoving forward we will write for an abstract -cosmos. If the reader wishes they can have in mind that is the -cosmos of quasi-categories[^7, 1.2.10], where isofibrations are isofibrations of quasi-categories (i.e. inner fibrations that lift along boundary inclusions into the nerve of the free living isomorphism), or even the -cosmos of Kan complexes[^7, 1.2.12].An important construction we will need when considering modules between -categories is that of sliced -cosmoi.Sliced -Cosmos[^7, 1.2.22]\nFor , the sliced -cosmos consists of objects: isofibrations functor spaces: from to defined by pullback isofibrations: commutative triangles with cone point and all legs isofibrations\nTerminal object , and products given by pullback Pullbacks and limits of towers of isofibrations created by Simplicial cotensor of with given by the pullback Additionally, for those familiar with the essential role Kan complexes play in the quasi-categorical model of -categories, it won't be surprising that an analogous class of objects in a general -cosmos will play an essential role in formal -category theory, particularly when discussing modules.Discrete -Category\nAn -category is said to be discrete if for all , is a Kan complex.\nWe can think of discrete -categories as generalizations of -groupoids as they can be equivalently characterized by the condition that all morphisms are isomorphisms[^7, 1.2.27], which is encoded by the statement that\nis a trivial isofibration.Module between -Categories\nA module from to in is a two-sided isofibration which is discrete as an object of and such that is cocartesian and is cartesian.\nThis modules will take the place of our pro-arrows in a suitable generalization of pro-arrow equipments to the setting of the -cosmos . In order to act as pro-arrows in an equipment we need that modules are suitably stable under base-change in the following sense.<br>Basechange of a Module [^7, 7.4.5]\nIf is a module from to and and are a pair of functors, then the pullback defines a module <img src=\"images/svg-cache/cb95f0f972a326785909b7760da0c67b.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nOur prime example of modules will be those obtained from the comma category construction. Namely, the arrow -category is a module, implying that for any co-span , the comma -category :<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/8c3bd474a691ce6bafcff7e1f865f553.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">where is used to indicate that it is a module from to .Now that we have our modules, or pro-arrows, we want to define a double category which will be our pro-arrow equipment we can do formal -category theory internal to. However, as we will see shortly this isn't strictly possible for a general -cosmos due to the fact that the natural composition of modules does not preserve the property of being discrete. In order to correct this we would need to require that our -cosmoi have suitable weak colimits. Instead of leaving their axiomatic construction at this point in order to obtain a pro-arrow equipment of modules, Riehl and Verity instead construct a weaker structure, known as a virtual equipment, as a full subcategory of a pro-arrow equipment of two-sided isofibrations.<br>Fibered Maps\nA fibered map of two-sided isofibrations from to is a fibered isomorphism class of strictly commuting diagrams\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/bea26a8ecac409c4d3992ef06bf44ffa.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nwhere two such diagrams with and are considered equivalent if there exists a natural isomorphism such that and .\nWe can view the -category of isofibrations from to in an -cosmos as a quotient of the homotopy -category . This -category exactly captures the notion of equivalence in in the sense that a pair of two-sided isofibrations are equivalent in if and only if they are isomorphic in this one-category.We can now define the double category which are virtual equipment will live insideDouble Category of Two-Sided Isofibrations\nThe homotopy -category of an -cosmos supports a (non-unital) double category of two-sided isofibrations whose: Objects are -categories\nvertical arrows are functors\nhorizontal arrows are two-sided isofibrations\nand whose squares with boundary and are maps of two-sided isofibrations over . This double category generally does not have a horizontal unit since the identity span is not generally a two-sided isofibration. However, when we restrict to the virtual double category of modules we will realize a unit from the arrow category. First let's recall the notion of a virtual double category, which can be thought of as an analogue of multicategories in the double categorical world.Virtual Double Category\nA virtual double category consists of A category of objects and vertical arrows\nFor any pair of objects and in a collection of horizontal arrows <br>Cells with boundary <img src=\"images/svg-cache/3918e27c764df2b06fd8328e1398a412.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nand composition given by pasting. an identity cell for vertical composition for every horizontal arrow . From our double category of two-sided isofibrations we can obtain a virtual double category with the same objects, vertical arrows, and -ary squares, as well as -ary cell of maps of two-sided isofibrations over given by<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/ab1b30e201282b6caf5870870b5057a1.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">whose vertical source is the -fold span composite of the sequence of spans [7, 8.1.11]. This construction gives us a unit, in the sense of virtual double categories, which is a -ary square with edges and horizontal two-sided isofibration .The virtual double category of modules can now be given as follows [7, 8.1.14]:Virtual Double Category of two-sided isofibrations\nThe virtual double category of modules is the full subcategory of the virtual double category of isofibrations whose objects are -categories\nvertical arrows are functors\nhorizontal arrows are modules from to -ary cells are fibered isomorphism classes of maps of two-sided isofibrations over , as above. Note the reason we needed to pass to virtual double categories is that , although being a two-sided isofibration, need not be a module (as it may fail to be discrete in ).In order to define a notion of Kan extension in it remains to show that this virtual double category has the structure of an virtual equipment.Virtual Equipment\nA virtual equipment is a virtual double category such that for any horizontal arrow and any pair of vertical arrows and , there exists a horizontal arrow and a unary cartesian cell satisfying the natural universal property\nevery object admits a unit horizontal arrow equipped with a nullary cocartesian cell satisfying the natural universal property (i.e. all -ary cells with object in their domain factor uniquely through and identities on the other components of the domain). <br>In , is exactly the arrow category as a module, while for and , we write for the base change given in <a data-href=\"An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules#^e47312\" href=\"board-talks/topology-seminar/an-introduction-to-formal-(infinity-)category-theory-via-modules.html#^e47312\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules &gt; ^e47312</a><a data-href=\"An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules#^e47312\" href=\"board-talks/topology-seminar/an-introduction-to-formal-(infinity-)category-theory-via-modules.html#^e47312\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules &gt; ^e47312</a>.

The modules and define conjoints and companions for , respectively.We can now begin formalizing Kan extensions in . This can be done using the naive theory of right extensions in any bicategory, where the virtual bicategory we will be considering is . Since virtual bicategories take a slightly different form let's make this universal property explicit.A right extension of a module along a module consists of a module together with a binary cell<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/9e177c3fe8932f951e06d44833d8337c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which is universal in the sense that for -ary cell of the form below-left, we have a unique factorization into a composite below right:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/8032de0e98b901ce6fd580c1cd13c153.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">We can now finally define what it means for to have a pointwise right Kan extension in [7, 9.3.3]:<br>Pointwise Right Extension\nA diagram of the form\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/e053c632ef763b129f1592a9ed2d0d83.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nin is a pointwise right Kan extension if and only if defines a right extension in .\nIn order to get left Kan extensions we use the co-dual notion of right lifts in . The reason that these are pointwise is that the extensions defined in this way are stable under pasting with exact squares (or equivalently comma squares), which corresponds classically to the condition that the Kan extensions are stable under post-composition with representables.With the notion of pointwise right Kan extensions we can immediately start doing formal -category theory in . This will be expanded on in a future note for a future talk, but for now let's cite some interesting constructions and results we obtain with this theory.Facts:\nPointwise right extensions along right adjoints exist and are given by restriction along the left adjoint\nTaking a right extension along a fully faithful functor (as defined in a pro-arrow equipment with horizontal identities ) has as structure transformation an isomorphism\nA right adjoint is fully faithful if and only if its counit is an isomorphism\nLimits in agree with the following definition: A limit of a diagram of -categories is a pointwise right extension as below right<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/79864ae0812155f77072df5b2d3e8e6c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which agree with the classical definition in cartesian closed -cosmoi. More generally, given a module and a functor , we can say that a functor defines a -weighted limit of if it covariantly represents the right extension of along .

interpretations and abstractions help us solve other real world problems. We'll start today with getting on the same page with what we mean by braids, before seeing if we can turn our physical intuition into a precise mathematical statement.Using a dowel or wooden bar, tie strips of colourful ribbon or string to the dowel, at least 1 meter in length, and hang the dowel up.\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912211705.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912211705.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 200px; max-width: 100%;\">Fig 1.

Braids are also closely related to knots and tangles, which appear in art, jewelry, and architecture throughout cultures across the world. A braid then involves wrapping the ribbons around each other, and then fixing the ends of the ribbons once we've finished wrapping:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912215930.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912215930.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 200px; max-width: 100%;\">Fig 2. A visual of five coloured ribbons (red, pink, blue, cyan, and green, from left to right) hanging from a dowel, which is itself supported by a blue string attached to a pin, as in Figure 1. The ribbons are know wrapped over and under each other, with the red ribbon wrapping under the pink ribbon, and the blue and cyan ribbons wrapping under the green ribbon.The reason why we need to fix the bottoms of the ribbons after braiding them is that otherwise the ends could just slide back to the original hanging position, but these should be two different braids. This raises the important question, that is also foundational to a lot of mathematics, which is what would it mean for two braids to be equivalent?\nThey should involve the same number of ribbons\nWe should be able to bend ribbons as long as the ends are fixed, without changing the braid\nThis leads to our first informal, but mathematical, definition of a braid:Braids as Strings in 3D\nAn -braid for an integer is a collection of strings in -space, which are disjoint (i.e. they do not intersect), and monotone (in the direction). The th braid starts at the point and ends at the point , for some possibly different integer .\nTwo braids will be said to be equivalent if one can be deformed to the other without moving endpoints or intersecting strings.\nNote: The monotonicity requirement ensures that we can't knot a single ribbon with itself, which would not be a braid (but would be something called a tangle!).Exercise\nDetermine if the two Braids below are equivalent or not given what we've discussed so far:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912222003.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912222003.png\" target=\"_self\">\nFig 3.

The ribbons on either dowel are braided together in a variety of ways.\nUsing the variable to indicate the direction our braids our going suggests another mathematical model for braids, which helps us get closer to a more precise mathematical definition.Braids as Time Histories or Particle Dances\nAn -braid for an integer is the time history of a collection of non-colliding particles in 2D space. More precisely, an -braid is a collection of continuous functions such that , and for all times if .\nThis definition motivates the visualization of walking along strings as they are built up into a braid.Ribbon Activity\nEach student gets a length of ribbon, with one end tapped to the ground under their feet. The students then walk in a path while unraveling the string or ribbon behind themselves before returning to one of the starting points, the whole time avoiding colliding with other students.\nQuestion What do the orientations of the crossings tell you about the particle paths?\nPulling your ribbon tight, see how the paths change, while giving you an equivalent, although visually very different, braid An important benefit of the particle dance perspective for braids is that it's easier to formalize what it means for two braids to be equivalent. Explicitly, we will say that an -braid is equivalent to an -braid if we have a family of continuous functionsso that , , and for all , is itself an -braid. The collection of functions can be thought of as a continuous family of braids. The first factor keeps track of the time evolution for the braids, while the second factor keeps track where we are in the family of braids. We can also think of the second factor as indicating how much we've deformed our initial braids so far.Now that we have some initial proposals for mathematical ways of formalizing braids, we can start investigating what types of properties and structures these braids have.Exercise\nOn a sheet of paper, or using strips of ribbon and tape, make a braid with 3 strings. Then at the bottom of the previous braid make another braid. We can view the result as a composite braid, though based on our formalism we have to be a bit careful, since our time should only go from to . To deal with the time issue, we can speed up the rate at which we trace the braids. In the particle model this means that for two braids and , their composite can be defined by taking the th trajectory to be The fact that we defined two braids to be equivalent if we can slide the strings to go from one presentation to another, while fixing endpoints, ensures that this definition doesn't depend on how we split up the interval . For example, we could trace the first braid in 1/3rd the time, and then the second braid in the remaining 2/3rds of the time:We could even take a brake in the middle before tracing the second braid\nOn Board: Draw out these examples, and/or use the ribbons.\nIn particular, the wiggling invariance ensures that we can put a collection of braids together two at a time, and the end result doesn't depend which pairs we put together first\nDraw on Board to clarify\nAdditionally, if we paste any braid with the braid of just straight ribbons, nothing happens. This tells us that braids can be given the structure of a group.Group\nA group consists of a collection of objects , thought of as symmetries of some underlying structure, together with a distinguished symmetry and a composition operation combining two symmetries. This data is subject to the following conditions: The distinguished symmetry is the do-nothing symmetry in the sense that for any other symmetry , .\nFor every symmetry in , an inverse symmetry such that .\nThe order in which a sequence of symmetries is combined two-at-a-time is independent of the resulting combined symmetry. For example, given a triple of symmetries in , we have the equality of symmetries Example The integers with addition is a group.\nThe rotational symmetries of a square (or triangle, circle, etc.) form a group.\nThe set of non-zero fractions forms a group with multiplication.\nThe permutations of -points form a group Translations of the plane form a group Question\nDoes the order in which we paste braids matter?\nYes!! This means that the braid group, , is not a commutative group. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" target=\"_self\">Tutorial on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-1-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" target=\"_self\">Survey on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-2-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" target=\"_self\">RTG-Braids.pdf</a><a href=\"#fnref-3-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" target=\"_self\">singapore tutorial Ghrist.dvi</a> <a href=\"#fnref-4-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Learning Objectives","level":2,"id":"Learning_Objectives_0"},{"heading":"Mathematical Braids (c.f.1234)","level":2,"id":"Mathematical_Braids_(c.f.[^1][^2][^3][^4])_0"},{"heading":"References","level":4,"id":"References_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-1-mathematical-braids.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20250912211705.png","images/pasted-image-20250912215930.png","images/pasted-image-20250912222003.png","images/pasted-image-20250912222605.png"],"createdTime":1757298213479,"modifiedTime":1757864671822,"sourceSize":10077,"sourcePath":"Math Outreach Notes/Math Circle Notes/Braid Groups/Lesson 1 - Mathematical Braids.md","exportPath":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-1-mathematical-braids.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":15,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-2-the-algebra-of-mathematical-braids.html":{"title":"Lesson 2 - The Algebra of Mathematical Braids","icon":"","description":"\nAble to describe how braids can be combined, both physically and mathematically\nAble to describe the definition of a group, and give basic examples including braids\nAble to go between the particle dance and configuration space definitions of braids\nLast week we discussed how to interpret physical braids in terms of two different precise mathematical definitions. Let's recall one of those definitions:Braids as Particle Dances\nA braid with strands, for an integer, is a collection of functions representing particles that don't collide, so that the following conditions hold: For each time , and distinct particles , For each particle , The collection of ending positions are the same as the collection of starting positions: Near the end of the first lesson we observed that if we have two braids with -strands, we can make a new braid by pasting them together<img src=\"images/svg-cache/f72f0f9ae69fecbde47c434e77af8378.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">we can make a new braid<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/a0d0be70ae860c66100e4d9a83b5fd98.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which can be equivalently drawn as<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/a587048dbc5049ac8c6d9690ebef0c22.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">In this lesson we're going to explore different properties related to this operation through a variety of activities and exercises.Exercise: Identities\nIs there a braid that when you compose it with any other braid it does nothing?\n<br>Exercise:\nConsider the braids below:\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/774a26b519c304d26d3299aa9aa606cf.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nFind braids that we can paste below these ones to undo them.\nTogether with associativity, these exercises show us that braids form what we call a group:Group\nA group consists of a collection of objects , thought of as symmetries of some underlying structure, together with a distinguished symmetry and a composition operation combining two symmetries. This data is subject to the following conditions: The distinguished symmetry is the do-nothing symmetry in the sense that for any other symmetry , .\nFor every symmetry in , an inverse symmetry such that .\nThe order in which a sequence of symmetries is combined two-at-a-time is independent of the resulting combined symmetry.

If no, explain your reasoning, if yes, give an example:\n<br>Hint:\nConsider the braids below:\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/56b3a0ad0373e0a9f5ef4896cf2717b3.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nDoes the order we put them together matter? Well if we do the left on top we get the braid on the left below, while if we do the right on top we get the braid on the right below:\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/21e6acb930c43b18542becc115dbd434.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nAs we've been seeing so far, we can make some very complicated braids. For example, we can do the same twist over and over to get the braid below:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/a23f2d8f9935be8704a3a75486bd6637.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">In particular, if we keep wrapping like this we can get infinitely many different braids, making the braid group pretty tricky to study. However, even though we have infinitely many possible braids, we can ask whether they are generated by some finite number of braids under the composition operation, and even better yet, if we can list finitely many relations between the generators. This leads to the notion of a presentation of a group.Presentation of a Group\nA presentation of a group is a collection of objects, such as , which generate , along with a collection of relations, such as , which determine how we can simplify expressions involving the generators.\nQuestion\nFor braids with -strands, what are some basic twists we have?\nThe braid group admits a presentation, which we refer to as the algebraic braid group . It has generators, , where is the braid crossing string over string , and the relations imposed areandThe first of these relations tells us that the order in which we cross strings is irrelevant as long as the two crossings don't involve the same strings:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/14b3c463c336bb02746f5b78160059e0.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">they just slide paste each other. The second relation is a bit less intuitive, but at least in the example below it tells us that if we cross the first strand over the second, and then over the third, which crosses under the first, this is the same as crossing the third strand under the second, and then under the first, which crosses over the third:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/680e8565179433d3496ae9baf0cecf0d.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">Exercise\nShow that the braid above satisfies and . Show that this implies commutes with all elements of .\n<br>Exercise\nDraw the braid with -strands :\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/d9c74f7c7f8192b9265cc3437d431554.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nWhat does this look like?\nQuestion\nCan we reduce the number of generators for ?\nHint: take any along with the partial twist . For example, using and we can get below:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/cb240b7493f3f1a68371d0e6e47976ca.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">A next step in studying a group involves breaking it up into smaller pieces. One such smaller piece for the braid group is what we call the pure braid group which only consists of those braids whose strands start and end at the same spot. For example, the full twist<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/d9c74f7c7f8192b9265cc3437d431554.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">is a pure braid, but the transposition<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/83b5d36fb4f862c45a0fb5001b3df3ba.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">is not. To recover information about the group from information about the pure braids, we also need to know about the braids we're missing. One way to isolate these braids is to pretend that the pure braids are trivial. This defines what we call the quotient group, , which is the same as the group of permutations on -letters . We can alternatively describe and in terms of configuration spaces, which give another way of formalizing braids, while also relating them to important applications in robotics.Configuration Space\nFor a space , its -th configuration space consists of those points in , which are ordered sequences of points in , , such that whenever (i.e. the points never overlap).\nThe pure braid group is then the fundamental group , while the full braid group is the fundamental group . Here the fundamental group, just like in our definition of particle dances, consists of paths in a space up to wiggling, but such that the paths must start and end at the same place. Additionally, the space consists of unordered sequences of points in , , such that whenever .\nThis allows us to have particles starting and ending at different positions\nApplication: Motion Planning\nConfiguration spaces are essential for planning the motion of large numbers of bodies moving about the same space so that they don't collide. Some examples are the following: Guided robots moving about a factory\nAir traffic control at a busy airport\nMotion planning on tracks Example\nWe can depict the configuration space for the letter as below:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250920004725.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250920004725.png\" target=\"_self\">\nExercise\nTry visualizing the configuration space for the letter . <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" target=\"_self\">Tutorial on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-1-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" target=\"_self\">Survey on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-2-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" target=\"_self\">RTG-Braids.pdf</a><a href=\"#fnref-3-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" target=\"_self\">singapore tutorial Ghrist.dvi</a> <a href=\"#fnref-4-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Learning Objectives","level":2,"id":"Learning_Objectives_0"},{"heading":"The Algebra of Mathematical Braids (c.f.1234)","level":2,"id":"The_Algebra_of_Mathematical_Braids_(c.f.[^1][^2][^3][^4])_0"},{"heading":"References","level":4,"id":"References_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"images/svg-cache/f72f0f9ae69fecbde47c434e77af8378.svg","fullURL":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-2-the-algebra-of-mathematical-braids.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["images/svg-cache/f72f0f9ae69fecbde47c434e77af8378.svg","images/svg-cache/a0d0be70ae860c66100e4d9a83b5fd98.svg","images/svg-cache/a587048dbc5049ac8c6d9690ebef0c22.svg","images/svg-cache/774a26b519c304d26d3299aa9aa606cf.svg","images/svg-cache/56b3a0ad0373e0a9f5ef4896cf2717b3.svg","images/svg-cache/21e6acb930c43b18542becc115dbd434.svg","images/svg-cache/a23f2d8f9935be8704a3a75486bd6637.svg","images/svg-cache/14b3c463c336bb02746f5b78160059e0.svg","images/svg-cache/680e8565179433d3496ae9baf0cecf0d.svg","images/svg-cache/d9c74f7c7f8192b9265cc3437d431554.svg","images/svg-cache/cb240b7493f3f1a68371d0e6e47976ca.svg","images/svg-cache/83b5d36fb4f862c45a0fb5001b3df3ba.svg","images/pasted-image-20250920004725.png"],"createdTime":1758325567653,"modifiedTime":1759092303011,"sourceSize":18031,"sourcePath":"Math Outreach Notes/Math Circle Notes/Braid Groups/Lesson 2 - The Algebra of Mathematical Braids.md","exportPath":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-2-the-algebra-of-mathematical-braids.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":16,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-3-recognizing-braids-using-algebra.html":{"title":"Lesson 3 - Recognizing Braids Using Algebra","icon":"","description":"\nAble to describe what the presentation of a group means in the example of braids\nAble to describe the word problem for groups\nAble to determine when two braids are different using their presentations\nOver the last two weeks we've learned how braids can be encoded mathematically using continuous functions, and we've seen that when we view them mathematically, braids exhibit the behaviour of something called a group. Recall that this means we can combine braids to make new braids<img src=\"images/svg-cache/a0d0be70ae860c66100e4d9a83b5fd98.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">and for any braid<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/b76a606aec4d92936416ba132743392a.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">we can find an inverse braid by flipping the braid and reversing its crossings:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/2087aea94f38187b40006ab88fa7a24d.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">The fact that these two braids are inverse means that when we combine them we get the basic braid with straight threads and no crossings.At the end of the last lesson we saw that there are an infinite number of braids, which can get extremely complicated, but luckily all braids can be built up by doing single crossings of neighboring strands:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/fd297ba8870cecc5dd8d92c8880bff25.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">In fact, we can describe the group of braids by using these neighbor crossings along with relations to tell us how we can put them together. This is related to the notion of presentations for groups which we mentioned last time:Presentation of a Group\nA presentation of a group is a collection of objects, such as , which generate , along with a collection of relations, such as , which determine how we can simplify expressions involving the generators.\nFor example, if is the braid group for three strands, then the generators are the neighbor twists, such as<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/9ea388166ead84eebcd2a1b9156d943a.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">while the only relation is that we have an equality<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/777ea4d96642054fb149ac13c7219133.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">Algebraically if represents the neighboring twist where the first strand goes over the second, and if represents the neighboring twist where the second strand goes over the third, then this relation saysIt turns out this completely determines how braids compose!! In general, if is the braid group on -strands, then it has generators , with relationswhich as above correspond to sliding our strands up or down, and relationswhich says that if we cross two strands, and then we cross two completely different strands, then the order we do this in doesn't matter. Visually this looks like we're just sliding up or down the crossings<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/bbda6c9e727ab31b1cef0cff3d8ee7b9.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\"><br>Exercise\nDraw the braid with -strands :\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/d9c74f7c7f8192b9265cc3437d431554.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nWhat does this look like?\nOur goal today is to see if we can use this mathematical setup to determine when two braids are the same or different. For example, by the end of the lesson we should be able to say whether the braids<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/72b348eaf50cd8247ae32485619d0f8c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">are the same or different in a systematic way. This is what's known as the word problem:The Word Problem\nIf is a group generated by some symmetries subject to a collection of relations, such as for example , how can I identify when two symmetries in are the same or different?\nSince braids form a group, we can always reduce the question of when two braids are equal by instead asking when some different, but related braid, can be pulled until we have no crossing strands.Question\nHow can we turn a problem about two braids being equal into a problem about whether a braid can be pulled straight or not? Given two braids, what would be the new braid that we want to pull straight?\nMathematically this comes from the fact that two symmetries and in a group are equal, , if and only if is the identity or do-nothing symmetry.Now we want to determine when a given braid is the same as the braid with no crossings, possibly after pulling the strands around. Since this means that the strands must all start and end at the same places, we can immediately reduce to those braids where all strands start and end at the same spot. We write for this collection of braids.Question\nIs still a group?\nAt this point in order to identity when braids are equivalent to the braid with no crossings, we proceed with a combing technique. The idea is that if we have a braid such as <br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/609a3cf0fd5fd2ed250e7cafbb4fa7a2.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">we start by combing out the last strand<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/cd51d2beec57b54816965acb182b3360.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">If this new braid can't be straightened out, then that means our original braid also can't be straightened out. To see whether this one can be straightened out we again comb out the last strand, which in this case gives the twist<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/df4fd50a8bea8e23cbc3fad487ad6e1f.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which can't be straightened out. If we end up combing out and hitting a point when the braid can be pulled straight, then we go back to the previous, which will only involve the last strand crossing over and under the other strands, while all the other strands don't touch. For example, this could look something like this:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/d3d1bb21295fa59890a7c90983fd3890.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">or more generally<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/ced932cbadba990b3135c4a7e63aee4b.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">Because of this we are reduced to determining when braids like this can be pulled until they have no crossings. Rhetorical Question\nHow can we determine when these kinds of braid can be straightened out?\nIf we think about the braid as represented by a particle dance, these braids can be considered as those particle dances where all but one of the particles remains stationary. Since the particles can't collide, we can represent this situation via a particle travelling on a disk with holes in it:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250926173536.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250926173536.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%;\">\nFig. A disk with a green, orange, and purple hole in it. A blue dot representing a particle lies on a blue curve that loops around the holes and represents the particle's motion.where now we don't have to we don't have to worry about crossings over. If we think about pulling the particle's history super tight, and bringing the wholes with it, this would be the same as if the particle lived on a little bouquet of circles:<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250926174116.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250926174116.png\" target=\"_self\">\nFig. Three circles attached at a single point, with a red dot representing a particle lying in their center.The particle doing loops in this tree can then be realized visually as if it was walking along a fractal tree.

The idea behind how we can show it is a new representation of braids, which is similar to the disk picture we previously had. Explicitly, we can think of a braid as something that takes in a disk made of putty with evenly spaced holes, like in the picture<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250926175538.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250926175538.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%;\">\nFig. A disk with a green, orange, and purple hole in the center, along with horizontal lines attaching the holes.and then pushes around the holes in the putty without every breaking them to get a new configuration:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250926180247.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250926180247.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%;\">\nFig. A disk with a green, orange, and purple hole in the center, where the holes have now been rearranged while keeping the lines attached.In these reconfigurations we've kept track of the centerline and how it moves. We can use this perspective to say when one braid is smaller than another. We do this by using the fact that the center line and its new position splits the disk into two pieces, and so one braid is smaller if part of it lies in the lower piece of another braid after pulling everything tight.We won't focus on this in the lesson, but it can be shown that if we have two braids and with , then for any other braid , .

Specifically, we will be illustrating the tools that cohomology gives us which aren't visible in homology (or are less straight forward to study in homology). Some of these features include cohomology groups, the ring structure on cohomology, and its Poincare duality characteristics.The contravariance of the cohomology functors make them much more accessible to these algebraic constructions we are going to investigate. However, as we will see, under certain assumptions the homology groups determine the cohomology groups.The main difficulty with defining a product on homology is that we want a map , which requires a map , but no such canonical map exists which doesn't lose information from one of the factors of . On the other hand, having a map is the same as a map , for which there is a natural such map, the diagonal. Such a map gives a variety of useful properties in cohomologyIn both the case of homology and cohomology we also have a cross product map (and similarly for cohomology) which in cellular homology sends cells of and of to the product cell in the product CW complex .Note that we have quite a bit of freedom when working with cohomology groups. In particular, for any abelian group , we can consider cohomology with coefficients in by forming the dual complex of a chain complex with respect to a group . We will begin by establishing that there, in a sense, is a universal such coefficient group, namely , and in what ways it is universal.To begin, let be a chain complex of finitely generated free abelian groups, . For , let denote the rank of , so . Thus, up to isomorphism the complex is of the form\nwhere can be thought of as an matrix with coefficients in . As with any chain complex, we can view as consisting of a collection of SESs with connecting maps between images and kernels<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/a8fbc6719370ea5fcf3846e2e6702e2d.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">Since submodules of free -modules are free of rank at most the rank of when is a PID, each of these short exact sequences split. (here we used the splitting lemma for Abelian categories to see that each sequence split by witnessing a retraction of the left inclusion) Let be the copy of in the splitting of , and , so we have sequences where the map is the restriction of the boundary map. It follows that is a direct sum of such short exact sequences.Now, let denote the rank of in and denote the rank of in , so . We can order the rows and columns of , we note that for all and all , and for all and all , . Thus, the boundary map is determined by the sub-block, . Note that we can transpose rows or columns and add linear combinations of rows or columns to give different bases for the free groups with a reduced boundary map matrix. This type of procedure allows us to express as direct sums of , , and for various . Taking duals we get the same decomposition, but with the arrows reversed, and this has the effect of shifting the torsion in the homology groups up a dimension.We aim to show that is determined by and . This is possible, but it is important to now that in general is not just the dual group. However, we always have a natural map . Indeed, if is in the kernel of the co-boundary map, so is trivial, then we obtain an induced map , which lives in . Further, if , the .Note that is surjective since the short exact sequence\nsplits, as all groups involved are free since subgroups of free abelian groups are free. Thus, we obtain a short exact sequence\nFurther, this short exact sequence is actually split since the splitting of the last sequence gives a retraction , and so any , which gives a map , can be extended to a map which vanishes on , and so lies in . Thus, composing with the quotient we get our desired section . It remains to show that depends only on and the homology of . First, note that we have a short exact sequence of chain complexes\nwhere the cycle and boundary complexes are equipped with zero maps between each degree. Taking duals this gives a short exact sequence in the opposite direction\nWe then obtain a long exact sequence of homology groups for these cochain complexes,\nwhere we have used the fact that the homology of a complex with all boundary maps zero is just the groups in the complex. When we break up this long exact sequence into short exact sequences we obtain the sequence\nusing exactness of the long exact sequence. But consists of those such that , which is equivalent to maps . In other words , and under this isomorphism the map becomes , and thus\nNote that taking the dual of the short exact sequence\nwe obtain a sequence\nwhich is generally not exact at . When it is exact we must have , and so would be an isomorphism. For example, this occurs when the original sequence splits, such as if is free.Note that since and are free, the short exact sequence for witnesses a free resolution of . Thus, the homology groups of the dual describe ext groups. Explicitly, we have that\nand\nThe left hand group only depends on and from the following general fact in homological algebra.Independence of Resolution in Ext Groups\nLet be an abelian category. If and are projective resolutions of and in , respectively, then every homomorphism extends to a map of augmented chain complexes , and any two such extensions are chain homotopic.\nFor any two projective resolutions and of an object in , there are natural isomorphisms for all .

Then we can apply the fact that is a projective module to obtain a map making the whole diagram commute. Hence, by induction we obtain a map of chain complexes . Suppose we had another lift, . Then set to be the zero map.

Inductively we obtain our desired chain homotopy, and since , this is also a chain homotopy between the maps from to without the augmentation.For part (2) let and be projective resolutions of a single object . Then by part (1) the identity map extends to a map and a map . Further, by the second part of (1) any two such extensions are homotopic, and in fact and are chain homotopic to the identity map. Thus, and form a chain homotopy equivalence between projective resolutions. Taking duals with respect to some abelian group , and form a chain homotopy equivalence still, so they induce isomorphisms on homology. In other words, we have that\nfor all .

Then we have a graded map making into a graded ring, where and are sent to their cup product , which is the co-chain whose value on a singular simplex is given by\nwhere multiplication is taken in on the right. In order for this to descend to cohomology we need a description of the boundary of a cup product.Boundary of Cup Product\nLet and . Then Proof.\nLet . Then we haveas desired. *** It follows that if and are cocycles, then so is , so the product restricts to a product on cocycles.

More generally, we have that\nWe refer to this resulting co-chain complex as the de Rham complex on , with its cohomology being the de Rham Cohomology of . Geometrically, an element of the -th de Rham cohomology of is represented by a cohomology class of closed -forms, which differ only by exact forms. One can think of the closed forms as being differential equations in a precise sense. Note that we could have made these definitions for any open subset, , obtaining a resulting complex with associated de Rham cohomology, .In general, the de Rham cohomology of is relatively easy to compute. Indeed, is simply connected, in fact contractible, and so a closed -form must always be exact. For 1-forms this can be derived from the fundamental theorem of calculus, while similar properties holds for higher forms. This is due to a more general fact that de Rham cohomology is actually a topological invariant.Another form of de Rham cohomology can be obtained by restricting our algebra to the algebra of smooth functions with compact support. This defines the compactly supported de Rham complex with cohomology . In this case we obtain an interesting kind of duality, with being in all degrees except , where it is . To see this, let us consider the example of along with the integration map\nThis linear operator vanishes on all exact -forms with having compact support since we can always restrict to an interval with endpoints outside the support of and use the fundamental theorem of calculus. Further, if we have in the kernel of the operator, then\nwill have compact support since does, and by the fundamental theorem of calculus . Thus,\nby the first isomorphism theorem.Example\nConsider where and are distinct points in . First, note that since is connected, the kernel of is precisely the constant functions, and so . Now, the kernel of TBD\nLet's now start introducing some computational tools for helping us find de Rham cohomology groups. Before doing this we should expand our definition of de Rham complexes to differentiable manifolds more generally. To begin, consider a smooth map . We have a natural pullback operation on , , via\nTo expand this to -forms more generally, and also in such a way that defines a map of co-chain complexes, we give\nwhere is the th component of the function . Using pullback to apply changes of coordinates, we can see that the exterior derivative is independent of the coordinate system on we are working with.Differential Forms on a Manifold\nA differential form on a manifold is a collection of forms for in the atlas defining , which are compatible in the sense that for any two opens and in the atlas, with and ,\nThe exterior derive and wedge product are defined by extending the definitions on the individual opens in the atlas. Further, becomes a contravariant functor on the category of smooth manifolds and smooth maps using pullback.\nRecall that manifolds have partitions of unity, where a partition of unity for a manifold with respect to an open cover is a collection of non-negative functions such that , is locally finite, and\nWe can further assume the supports of the are compact, if we wish, provided we possibly use a different index set.To begin suppose is a manifold and for and open. Then we have inclusions\nApplying we get the restrictions\nTaking the difference of the last two maps we obtain a short exact sequence of co-chain complexesThis is a special case of the statement that forms a flasque sheaf on . Indeed, differential forms are uniquely determined by their restrictions to open covers, so the first map is injective and the sequence is exact at the middle term. To show surjectivity of the last map take a partition of unity subordinate to the open cover . Then any -form on can be given by\nwhere we can view and as -forms on and , respectively.<br>From the long exact sequence of homology induced by a short exact sequence of chain complexes <a data-href=\"Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^ea9110\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^ea9110\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^ea9110</a><a data-href=\"Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^ea9110\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^ea9110\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^ea9110</a>, we obtain the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for de Rham cohomology\nwhere the co-boundary map takes a closed form on considers the differentials , and takes a closed -form in which maps onto it. Thus, is on and on .Support of a Form\nLet be a -form on a manifold . For any we have a natural map given by evaluating coefficients at . Then the support of the -form is defined to be We can also obtain a Mayer-Vietoris sequence when working with compactly supported de Rham cohomology. Here we have to be a little careful since in general pulling back a form with compact support along a smooth map need not produce a form also with compact support. However, if we restrict to a certain subclass of smooth maps we can obtain a well-defined functor . We have two options:\nDefine as a contravariant functor on the category of smooth manifolds with smooth proper maps between them\nDefine as a covariant functor under inclusions of open sets\nTo see how this second definition would work, let be the inclusion o an open set. Then can be given by extending a form on by zero to a form on . For now we work with this covariant version of since it will be helpful for proving Poincare duality, even for noncompact manifolds. In this case our Mayer-Vietoris sequence looks like\nwhich gives a long exact sequence on cohomology.Differential forms provide a wide range of tools. One of the most important such tools is their use in characterizing orientability of manifolds and the ability to integrate against them. If is a function with compact support, we denote its integral (Lebesgue or Riemann) by\nwhere the absolute values are used to signify the difference between normal integration and integration along forms, where the order of integration matters, since it describes a local orientation on the space. We can define then its integral with respect to a standard form by\nAs defined thus far, this depends on a choice of coordinates. If we have a change of coordinates, i.e. a diffeomorphism, , where , for new coordinates on , then we can see that\nwhere is the Jacobian determinant of .It follows that if , we have the change of coordinates\nOn the other hand, the change of variables formula reads\nso , which preserves sign if is orientation-preserving, and reverses sign if is orientation-reversing.Oriented Atlas\nLet be a differentiable manifold with atlas . We say that the atlas is oriented if all transition functions are orientation preserving.\nA manifold is said to be orientable if it has an oriented atlas.\nNext we show that being orientable is equivalent to the existence of a global non-vanishing -form (for ).Orientable in terms of -form\nA manifold of dimension is orientable if and only if it has a global nowhere vanishing -form.\nProof.\nFirst, observe that a diffeomorphism is orientation preserving if and only if is a positive multiple of at all points.() First suppose has a nowhere vanishing -form . Now, let be a coordinate map on an atlas in . Then for some smooth function which is no-where vanishing. It follows that is either positive or negative. After possible composing with the orientation-reversing diffeomorphism given by , we can assume that all such are positive. Then, pulls to , which is a positive multiple of itself, so the resulting atlas is oriented.() Next, suppose we have an oriented atlas . Then for all , , where is a positive function. Then\nWrite , so , with . Take a partition of unity sub-ordinate to this atlas and define . Then at each point in , all the finitely many forms which have are also themselves positive multiples of one-another. Thus, is nowhere vanishing. *** If and are global nowhere vanishing -forms on an orientable manifold , then or some smooth non-vanishing function . If we say and are equivalent. It follows that if is connected, then we can place nowhere vanishing -forms in two equivalence classes. Either class is called an orientation on , and we write for the choice of such an orientation.Now, we can integrate over an orientable manifold , with orientation . If (a top form), we can define its integral by\nwhere is an oriented atlas for the orientation on , and is a partition of unity with respect to this atlas, and we interpret the integrals on the right as\nWe now show this is independent of our choice of oriented atlas associated to and our choice of partition of unity.Invariance of Definition of Integral on Forms\nFor a compact top form , the integral is independent of the choice of oriented atlas and partition of unity .\nProof.\nLet be a global nowhere vanishing -form associated to the orientation .

Homology is an algebraic homotopy invariant of spaces which are incredibly important, largely due to their better computability over higher homotopy groups. In particular, simplicial, or sometimes called cellular homology, gives an explicit algorithm for computing all homology groups for a CW complex from the combinatorial data of its cell structure, with the chain complex defining the homology groups encoding cells in each dimension and attaching data in the boundary maps of the chain complex.The fundamental building block for simplicial homology is the -simplex. We state the definition of the -simplex purely abstractly, though in most applications an -simplex is viewed as a subspace of Euclidean space with standard basis chosen.-simplex\nAn -simplex, for an integer, in an dimensional real vector space , where , associated to a collection of vectors , with linearly independent, in the subspace\nwhere the are referred to as barycentric coordinates.\nThe standard -simplex is the -simplex in associated with the standard basis . We will write for an -simplex with specified vertices. For purposes of homology, and in particular for tracking orientations of boundaries, the ordering of the vertices in an -simplex will be considered part of the data. For example, such an ordering specifies a linear homeomorphism from the standard -simplex onto any other any -simplex , preserving vertices and orientations, so we can take any -simplex which is most convenient in a given situation. Indeed, such a map is given by .There are a number of important constructions and terminology associated with simplices. Firstly, removing a vertex from the list gives a face, (here the th face), of the original simplex. We will write for the union of all faces in the -simplex , and refer to it as the boundary of . Note that as a closed subspace of the ambient vector space resides in, is its interior, sometimes referred to as its open sub-simplex. For computational purposes a useful notion is that of a -complex structure or triangulation of a space . Such a structure is determined by a collection of maps , for varying , satisfying the following:\nThe restriction is injective, and is partitioned by the images of such injective maps\nEach restriction of to a face of is one of the maps , where we identify a face of with using the natural linear homeomorphism described previously. has the weak topology with respect to the (i.e. is open if and only if is open for all )\nNote that such a quotient space must be Hausdorff, so property (3) implies that the interior of any simplex is mapped homeomorphically onto its image. Indeed, a triangulation is a special form of a CW structure.Moving forward, let be a topological space that admits a triangulation, and fix such a triangulation , where indexes the -simplices in the triangulation. Let throughout, and let be the free abelian group on the set of -simplices, . Elements of are called -chains. In order to turn these groups into a chain complex we define the boundary map for to be the map obtained by the following action on basis elements , with simplex :\nThis indeed defines a boundary map due to the alternating behaviour of the sum, as can be checked by a straightforward computation with re-ordering and grouping summands.Therefore, for every triangulated space , with specified triangulation, we obtain its simplicial complex . The -th simplicial homology of is then the -th homology group of this chain complex, namely\nAlthough it may not be evident right now, we will later see that these simplicial homology groups are independent of the choice of triangulation on . This will be shown by witnessing agreement with the later defined singular homology of , which does not involve such choices. We refer to elements of homology groups as homology classes, and say that two cycles representing the same homology class are homologous.Orientable Closed Surface\nConsider an orientable closed surface of genus , , which we can represent by a quotient of a -gon. Order the edges on the -gon . To give a triangulation we add a vertex to the center of the -gon and then input outward oriented edges to all vertices, giving -simplices. Additionally, after identification we have -simplices and -simplices. Thus, the simplicial complex for is\nwhere is the zero map for the edges , and mapping any edge from the center vertex to the common vertex on the -gon to . Thus, we have that\nIn particular, , which agrees with the fact that is path-connected. We denote the -simplices by , , where attaches to and attaches to . Then , and , . Then we have that\nwhere we interpret . It follows that the element being acted on is in the kernel if and only if for all and for all . Thus,\nso . Now, observe that we can also write the image as\nThus, we have , , , and , which span the image for each . Observe that any linear combination which is zero must reduce to the form\nwhere . Thus, we must have that for all , giving\nwhich holds if and only if for some fixed integer . Thus, we have a short exact sequence\nso . Thus, .\nObserve that the alternating sum of ranks for , is exactly the Euler characteristic of . This is a general phenomenon.Now, although useful for computations, simplicial homology is difficult to develop tools for on its on due to its strict construction. Instead we move now to the more abstract setting of singular homology, before later showing that the two agree, assuming the space has a triangulation.Moving forward, let denote an arbitrary space (i.e. no triangulation assumptions). A singular -simplex in is then a continuous map out of the standard -simplex. We can then define singular chains for to be the free abelian group on all singular -simplices, where is defined identically to the boundary maps in simplicial chains.Again, we obtain a chain complex , and we refer to the homology of this complex as the singular homology of , . One of the first immediate benefits of this definition is that is functorial, sending a continuous map of spaces to the map which at sends a basis element to its post-composition by , . In particular, this implies that singular homology is homeomorphism invariant, and in fact it is also homotopy invariant, as we will soon see. Note that we can replace be a singular complex with -complexes for each singular -complex , and evident attachings. These spaces are rarely equivalent, but by construction .We now make use of the abstract nature of singular homology do quickly derive some interesting properties.Homology in Terms of Path-Components\nLet be the decomposition of a space into its path-components. Then the canonical map\nis an isomorphism.\nProof.\nNote that any must factor through some path-component of since is path-connected. This implies the desired isomorphism on chains, . Since taking kernels and images in commute with direct sums, and quotients commute with direct sums, we obtain the desired isomorphism on the level of homology. *** -th Homology of a Space\nIf is non-empty and path-connected then . Hence, for any space , .\nProof.\nNote that . Consider the map sending each . Then . On the other hand, if , then . By expanding terms if necessary, we can assume that each . Then for some , so that the all cancel. After possible re-ordering we can assume for and for . Then we can group the sum as . But as is path-connected, each is in the image of , so the sum is also in the image and hence . Therefore . *** This result gives a first instance of the deep connection between homology and homotopy groups. Next we observe a type of dimension or boundedness result for singular homology.Dimension Theorem for Singular Homology\nIf is a point, then for , and .\nProof.<br>\nThe claim is <a data-href=\"Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^f82511\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^f82511\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^f82511</a><a data-href=\"Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^f82511\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^f82511\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^f82511</a>. Now for all , and sends the unique -simplex to the alternating sum , which is zero if and only if is odd, and otherwise. In other words, we have alternating identity and zero maps, which implies that the sequence is exact for , and so . *** Due to these two results a copy of at the th homology can sometimes be viewed as a bit superfluous, and can be annoying in computations. In order to account for this, we often will work with reduced homology groups, , which we can define as the homology of the augmented chain complex\nObserve that by construction for , and we have a short exact sequence\nwhich splits since is a free -module, so .Next we aim to show the claim, previously mentioned, that singular homology is a homotopy invariant. This is equivalent to the statement that homotopic maps are sent to identical group homomorphisms on the level of homology. We will abuse notation and write for the map induced on homology by a map . To prove this claim we first recall that chain homotopic maps of chain complexes induce the same maps on homology.Chain Homotopic Maps are Equal on Homology\nLet be maps of chain complexes which are chain homotopic, so there exist maps for all such that\nThen for all .\nProof.\nLet be an -cycle. Then we have that\nis an -boundary in , and hence zero in homology. Thus . *** Now, it suffices to show that taking singular complexes sends topologically homotopic maps to chain homotopic ones. is a Homotopical Functor\nLet be homotopic maps of spaces. Then are chain homotopic.\nProof.\nLet be the homotopy from to . Let and we need to define a map . Let be a singular -simplex. Now, we want to sub-divide into simplices. Let and , such that including and then projecting onto gives the same map. We interpolate between these -simplices using intermediate steps, going from to , and generally from to . Note that these are boundaries to -simplices of the form . Then in this way is the union over these -simplices.We can then define as the alternating sum\nIt remains to show that these maps satisfy our desired boundary condition. This, like the proof of the vanishing of boundary maps, is an index chasing argument with alternating sums. *** Note that all of these homotopy invariance results also apply equally well for reduced homology.Now that we have established homotopy invariance we move to some of the first powerful tools for working with singular homology. In particular, we aim to prove an important relationship between the homology groups , , and when . We will be able to obtain a particularly strong result when dealing with good pairs.Good Pairs\nA pair of a space and a non-empty subspace is said to be a good pair if is closed and there is some open neighborhood , with , such that deformation retracts (strongly) onto .\nFor example, as can be proven inductively, all CW pairs are good pairs. Now, before continuing this theory we need some preliminaries which are more general and allow us to define and work with homology of pairs. These will be studied in what is known as relative homology groups. Namely, if is a space with subspace , we write for the quotient complex\nThus, we can think of chains in as being chains in which are trivial if they lie in . Our relative homology groups are then the homology groups of the chain complex , denoted . We refer to elements of these homology groups as relative cycles, where they consist of chains that have boundaries being cycles in . Such a relative cycle is homologous to if and only if it is a boundary, up to a chain in .Note that if we have a triple of space we obtain an exact sequence of chain complexes\nWe now aim to show that such complexes induce long exact sequences on the level of homology, which is a direct consequence of the snake lemma that we briefly recall here:<br>Theorem: Snake Lemma\nIf we have a map of sequences in an abelian category <img src=\"images/svg-cache/d7c2b7b6a544de83d31faff45146f28e.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nwhere the rows are exact, then we obtain a long exact sequence Proof.\nBy the Freyd-Mitchell embedding theorem we can prove the claim in for some ring using diagram chasing. In this case the map sends a cycle to an element of the cokernel of by snaking through the diagram. Indeed, since the top row is exact we have a for which , and then , so there exists such that . Then we define in . A simple (yet tedious) diagram chase argument shows this is a well-defined group homomorphism and gives the desired long exact sequence. *** As a simple corollary we obtain the following result on long exact sequences in homology:Corollary: Long Exact Sequence of Homology\nLet be a short exact sequence of chain complexes. Then we obtain a long exact sequence on homology\nwith the boundary maps natural.\nProof.<br>\nFirst, by <a data-href=\"Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^244e61\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^244e61\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^244e61</a><a data-href=\"Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^244e61\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^244e61\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^244e61</a> we obtain for all an exact sequence\nAlternatively, we can take kernels in our second row of the snake lemma, such as , instead the whole groups, i.e. , to get the long exact sequence\nNote that if , we have some with , so . But then by construction of in the snake lemma, , so kills boundaries. It follows that we obtain an induced map giving an exact sequence\nFurther, from our construction in the snake lemma these boundary maps commute with chain maps. *** As an immediate consequence we obtain the long exact sequence of a triple as well as the long exact sequence of the pair Applying long exact sequence of the triple to the triple we obtain the long exact sequence of reduced homology for a pair:\nIn these lasts two cases the boundary map takes on an especially form, simply sending a homology class in represented by a relative cycle to the class of its boundary, , which by definition of relative cycles is a cycle in , and so lands in .It follows by exactness that relative homology of a pair is trivial if and only if the inclusion induces isomorphisms on homology. An important result in the case of pairs is that we still have homotopy invariance.Homology of Pairs is Homotopical\nIf are homotopic as maps of pairs, then .\nProof.<br>\nSince the homotopy is done through maps of pairs, the prism chain homotopy in <a data-href=\"Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^a67bc4\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^a67bc4\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^a67bc4</a><a data-href=\"Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology#^a67bc4\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/topological-homotopy-theory/(co)homology/basics-of-homology-simplicial-and-singular-homology.html#^a67bc4\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Basics of Homology - Simplicial and Singular Homology &gt; ^a67bc4</a> restricts to a map , and so induces relative chain homotopies . Then the same computations given previously give that this indeed defines a chain homotopy, and so . *** In order to obtain our desired result relating quotients of spaces we will need another powerful tool of homology known as excision. This will first require that we introduce and prove a result about a notion known as barycentric subdivision, which can be thought of as an argument to partition simplices in an ordered way so that we can apply a Lebesgue number lemma type result.Chains in Covers\nLet be a space with a collection of subspaces whose interiors cover . Let be the subcomplex generated by simplices whose image lies in some set in the cover. Let denote the -th homology of this cover.\nOne of the many reasons for considering the chain complex associated to a cover comes from the following result.Exact Sequence of Cover Chain Complex\nLet be an open cover on . Then there is a (split) short exact sequence\nwhere the right map is the fold map and the left map is given on by mapping an -chain to in the coordinate, in the coordinate, and zero in all other coordinates.\nProof.\nBy construction the left map is injective and the right map is surjective, so it remains only to see that we have exactness at the center term. Let , so that , where since are working with sums only finitely many terms are non-zero. Let be the opens in the cover such that . Let's write , where the are distinct singular -simplices. Then we have that\nWe proceed by induction on . If then we must have that and after possible re-ordering for all . In this case and have image landing . Thus, we have that the element is the image of . Now, suppose the claim holds for some . Then for each we must have that lies in for some . For each choose one such , denoted , and let , and otherwise let . Then we have , and by the inductive hypothesis there exists such that its image is for and zero at all other components. On the other hand, the difference is exactly the image of\nso , as desired, so the sequence is exact. ***\nWe now show that up to homotopy the singular chain functor is a cosheaf valued in chain complexes. This relies on the procedure of Barycentric subdivision for -simplices in order to apply the Lebesgue number lemma.Barycentric Subdivision for Covers\nLet be the natural inclusion. Then is a chain homotopy equivalence, and hence induces isomorphisms on homology.\nProof.\nThe proof of this result will require the process known as barycentric subdivision. We proceed in four stages: Barycentric subdivision of Simplices: Consider an -simplex . We define its barycenter to be the point . We then decompose into the -simplices , where is constructed inductively as an -simplex in the barycentric subdivision of some face . If , the barycentric subdivision of is just . If , , and if , then we take , , and , as well as In particular, the vertices in the barycentric subdivision of are the barycenters of all -dimensional faces for . For these are just the original vertices. This barycentric subdivision of induces a -complex structure on in terms of simplices of diameter at most times the diameter of . Indeed, this is precisely the maximum distance between two vertices in a given simplex. For this, consider an -simplex in the subdivision, . We proceed by induction on , noting that for . If then the diameter is always zero, so there is nothing to prove. Now, let be vertices in . If neither nor are the barycenter, , then the lie in a barycenter of a common face in , so the claim holds by the inductive hypothesis. Otherwise, suppose is the barycenter. If , then\nwhere the last max is exactly the diameter of , as desired. Barycentric Subdivision of Linear Chains: Let be a convex subset and let denote the subgroup of generated by linear maps (here a linear map is fully determined by its action on the vertices, sending all other convex linear combinations to convex linear combinations in ). Since boundary maps are given by restriction this indeed defines a sub-chain complex . For convenience we augment by .\nAt each point , we obtain a homomorphism given on a basis element by (note: this can be done since is convex and we are considering linear chains). This is a kind of cone operator with tip . Observe that applying boundary maps we obtain the relation\nso is a chain homotopy between the identity and the zero map on , so the complex is contractible.\nNow, we construct our subdivision homomorphism by induction on. Let be a linear -simplex and let be the image of the barycenter of under . Then we set . We start the induction by setting to be the identity. Note that it is also the identity when as\nGeometrically, , for an -simplex which is an embedding (so a genuine -simplex in ) is an alternating sum over the barycentric subdivision of .\nNow, I claim is a chain map. Since and are identities we need only check for , where , inductively. Observe we can compute\nwhere the second last equality is by the inductive hypothesis.\nNow, we construct a chain homotopy between and the identity inductively. For we set . For , we inductively define . Note that . Now, suppose . Then we compute\nwhere we have used the inductive hypothesis and the inductive definition of . Note that since , these chain homotopy relations still hold. Barycentric Subdivision of General Chains: We can now perform barycentric subdivision in general. We define the subdivision operator in this context, , by where the inner is the for the convex space from (2). Since our original subdivision map is a chain map, so it this one. We also define the chain homotopy in the same manner, , and since the boundary formula holds for the in (2) and pushforward by a map is linear, we have that it still holds.\nThus, . <br>\nIterated Barycentric Subdivision: Now that we can perform barycentric subdivisions both geometrically and algebraically we can begin proving the claim by performing an iterated barycentric subdivision until we reach a point where the diameters of our simplices are less than the Lebesgue number for the induced covers on the . Note that since chain homotopies are transitive we can obtain a chain homotopy between and the iterate . Explicitly, such a homotopy can be given by the sum . Consider an -simplex in .

Further, if , Note that by definition of . Additionally, the remaining terms are linear combinations of for the restriction of to a face, so in particular . Hence, , which all lie in since since maps as it doesn't expand the image of a simplex. Thus, we can view as a chain map , where by construction we have .

Cellular homology is very efficient for computations of homology groups of CW complexes by reducing homology computations to computations of degrees for maps between spheres. We will be constructing cellular homology as a homology of a homology theory for pairs using singular homology. Before we can do this we must establish some results about how singular homology of pairs interacts with CW complexes and their skeleta.Lemma: Singular Homology of CW Complexes\nLet be a CW complex.

If is an -cell of , then\nwhere is the degree of the map that composes the attaching map of with the quotient collapsing to a point.\nNote that the number of non-zero terms in the sum is necessarily finite since the image of has compact closure.

First, the map sends the generator to a generator of the summand corresponding to in . Then commutativity of the left diagram gives . Note that the map is the projection of onto its summand corresponding to . Using the commutativity of the diagram, this projection corresponds to the map\nas desired.(non-)Orientable Closed Surfaces\nLet be the closed orientable surface of genus with CW structure of one -cell, -cells, and one -cell which is attached according to the product . The associated cellular chain complex is\nwhere is . Since each and appear in the product with its inverse, must also be , and hence\nFor the non-orientable closed surface of genus , , the attaching map is . Thus, the boundary map is specified by , since each appears with total exponent in the attaching map. It follows that 3D Torus\nLet . Using the product structure on it has one -cell, three -cells, three -cells, and one -cell. Thus, our cellular chain is of the form\nwhere as in our other examples must be zero. Now, the -cells are the product cells , , and . Looking at, for example, the attaching map of we see\nwhere the two copies of in each part of the union on the left must be sent to opposite orientation attaching maps, implying that is in fact zero. A similar argument shows that is zero, and thus the cellular chains align with the cellular homology groups.\nMoore Spaces\nFor an abelian group and an integer , a Moore space of is a space such that and for . We will, for the sake of this work, also require that be simply-connected if .\nIf we can take to be with a cell attached by a map of degree . Then any finitely generated group can be obtained by taking a wedge sum of finitely many such spaces, as well as finitely many copies of .\nNow, suppose is not finitely generated and let be a quotient map from a free abelian group . The kernel of this homomorphism is free, being a submodule of a free module over a PID. Let be a basis or and be a basis for , and write . Then, let , so . Then we want, for each , to attach a cell to via a map such that the composite of with the projection onto has degree . This will then give the homology groups we want.\nWe have map the complement of disjoint balls in to the -cell of , while sending of the balls onto the summand by maps of degree if , or degree if .\nNote that we can take a wedge sum of Moore spaces to obtain a connected CW complex with any sequence of homology groups in dimensions . Real Projective Space Recall that has an induced CW structure consisting of one -cell for each dimension , induced by its realization as a quotient of under a action. In particular, is attached via the -sheeted covering projection for each . For the boundary map , , we want the degree of the composite . We can observe that restricts to a homeomorphism from the components of onto , and these two homeomorphisms are obtained from each other by precomposing by the antipodal map of , which has degree from previous work. Then , and so is either or multiplication by whether is odd or even, respectively. Thus, we have that For finite CW complexes we can define their Euler characteristic by the alternating sum , where is the number of -cells of . This can be generalized to other finite dimensional spaces using homology, as the following theorem shows.Euler Characteristic in Terms of Homology\nLet be a finite CW complex. Then .\nProof.\nThis fact can be expressed algebraically. Let\nbe a chain complex of finitely generated abelian groups. Then we have short exact sequences and , which implies that\nand Substituting we find . The proof then follows by applying this result to the chain complex of cellular chains of . *** An important generalization of the homology theory presented thus far is homology with coefficients in abelian groups other than the integers. Explicitly,we have that\nand since tensoring is left-adjoint, so commutes with colimits\nSince commutes with colimits and finite limits, all of the theory we have developed thus far still applies, including all the long exact sequences we derived. All of the cellular homology work also follows through, with one additional result needed:Degree for Homology with coefficients\nIf has degree , then is multiplication by .\nProof.\nNote that homology with coefficients in is in fact natural in , due to the fact that tensoring is a bifunctor. In particular, this implies that if we take the unique map taking to , then the naturality square that results implies that , as desired. *** Homology of Projective Space over a Field\nThe cellular chain complex for with coefficients in a field is\nIf has characteristic then for . On the other hand, if has characteristic different from , then for and , if is odd, and otherwise.\nWe now begin investigating some applications and interesting computations that can be done with homology. The first we will start with is the notion of degree.The notion of the degree of a map is incredibly prolific in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, and beyond, and what we discuss here will only be a minor historical introduction to degree as it was investigated by Brouwer for maps of spheres.Explicitly, given a map , where , the induced map on homology is an endomorphism on an infinite cyclic group, so must be of the form for any and some fixed integer depending only on . This integer will be called the degree of , and we will refer to it as . We begin by noting some simple properties of degree that follow from properties of homology: as if is not surjective. Indeed, in this case let . Then factors through , where since is contractible. Hence .\nSince homology is homotopical, if then , so the degree is a homotopy invariant. In fact, the converse is also true, though we will not prove it here. since . It follows that if is a homotopy equivalence. if is a reflection of , fixing the points in a subsphere and interchanging complementary hemispheres.\nThe antipodal map , , has degree since it can be realized as the composite of reflections, each changing the sign o a single coordinate in .\nIf has no fixed points then . For this we can consider the line segment from to given by , , which doesn't pass through the origin if . Due to this, the formula\ndefines a homotopy from to the antipodal map.\nLet's now consider some interesting applications of degree, giving an idea for its prevalence in mathematics.Hairy-Ball Theorem has a continuous field o nonzero tangent vectors if and only if is odd.\nProof.\nFirst, suppose is a vector field on . Note that for all , through the natural embedding of into we can realize the tangent space as the orthogonal complement of in . If for all , we can normalize it, and so suppose that is a unit length tangent field on . Then for all and , the vectors lie in the unit circle in the plane spanned by and . Taking from to we obtain a homotopy from the identity on to the antipodal map . From our previous remarks this implies that , and so , which is only possible if is odd.On the other hand, if , for some integer , we can define to obtain a tangent vector field on which is always of unit length, and hence never zero. *** Another nice application of degree is with respect to the class of groups which can act freely on the sphere, for even .Groups that can act freely on for even is the only nontrivial group that can act freely on if is even.\nProof.\nSince homeomorphisms must have degree , an action of a group on determines a degree homomorphism . If the action is free, sends each nontrivial element of to by property (7) above. When is even, has trivial kernel, and this is only possible if (up to equivalence). *** As these examples have shown, degree, although a simple enough invariant to describe, can be incredibly powerful, so it is important to have sufficient tools for computing it. Consider a map , , such that we have a point with finite. Let be disjoint open neighborhoods of these points, mapped into a single neighborhood of . Then for each , so we have a diagram of homology groups<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/2cf9b6a3b4e52ca48480c09afe27c5d9.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">where the isomorphisms on the top half are by excision, while the isomorphisms on the bottom half are by the long exact sequence for a pair along with the contractibility of minus a point.

If maps each homeomorphically onto , then for each . Thus, we have a powerful way of determining local degrees. We can then use these to compute global degrees.Degree from Local Degrees\nLet , , be a map. Then for any such that is finite, we have the equality Proof.<br>\nBy Excision we have an isomorphism .

The commutativity of the upper square then implies that the middle takes to , and so is taken to . Finally, the lower square's commutativity implies that *** Constructing Maps of Specific Degrees\nLet be the quotient obtained by collapsing the complement of disjoint open balls in to a point, and let identify all summands to a single sphere (the sum map). Then let . For almost all (in the measure-theoretic sense), we have consisting of one point in each . Now, the local degree of at a given is since is a homeomorphism near . Precomposing with reflections of the summands in , if needed, we can ensure each local degree is either or . Then we can produce a map with degree .\nAnother important result relates the degree of a map to the degree of its suspension.Suspension Preserves Degree\nLet , , be a map. Then .\nProof.\nLet denote the unreduced cone with base . Then is the suspension of . Then taking the cone of we obtain a map of pairs , with quotient . Since the boundary map for long exact sequences of pairs is natural, we can use , along with the long exact sequence of the pair for reduced homology to conclude that and are multiplication by the same integer. *** We now construct another long exact sequence for homology in an analogous manner to excision, the Mayer-Vietoris sequence.

Then observe that since only the points in are identified in . But is open in the product topology, so by definition of the quotient topology in is open. Note that in , so is closed in .Next, consider the set in . Then its pre-image under is in , which is open in the product topology, so is open in the quotient topology on . Note that is continuous and bijective onto its image. Further, for any open , , since only points in are identified, so by definition of the quotient topology is open. It follows that is a homeomorphism onto its image in .
