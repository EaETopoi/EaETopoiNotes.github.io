of an Ambidexterity seminar at UIUC in Fall 2025. For notation please refer to the previous note introducing semiadditivity.Recall from last time that if a map of -finite spaces is -ambidextrous for an -category , then we obtain a norm equivalencewhere , for given by pre-composition. This norm map allows us to define integration of families of maps:which can be given by the compositeIntegrating the identity morphism yields the notion of -cardinality.-cardinality\nLet and let be a -ambidextrous map. We have a natural transformation given by the composition For a -ambidextrous space , we write and call the -cardinality of .\nNote that for a given object , is exactly .Motivating Example\nLet be a semiadditive -category.

We have the following universal example of an -semiadditive -category:Universal Case\nFor the symmetric monoidal -category of spans is the universal -semiadditive -category. For every , we have Note that is the set of isomorphism classes of -finite spaces with semiring structure given by Similarly, is the universal presentable -semiadditive -category. The Yoneda embedding induces a fully-faithful -semiadditive symmetric monoidal functor taking an -finite space to the free -commutative monoid on .\nHomotopy Cardinality\nFor a -finite space , the homotopy cardinality of is the rational number We say an -category is semirational if it is -semiadditive (i.e. -finite spaces are -ambidextrous, which are contractible, empty, and discrete spaces) and for each , multiplication by is invertible in (e.g. or ). Here multiplication by on an object is given by the cardinality , which is the composite A semirational -category which admits all -finite colimits is automatically -semiadditive, and for every -finite space , we have that its cardinality is its homotopy cardinality: This comes from the fact that the cardinality is additive, and for every fiber sequence of -finite spaces where is connected, . In Chromatic homotopy theory we often come across examples of -semiadditive -categories of higher height. For a given prime , and , let be the Morava -theory spectrum of height at the prime . We have that the localizations and are -semiadditive. For , , and the cardinalities recover the homotopy cardinality. Similarly, since is -local for all , if is a -finite space whose homotopy groups have cardinality prime to , then the -local cardinality of coincides with the homotopy cardinality for all by the previous example. However, this does not hold in general for -finite spaces whose cardinality is not prime to .To study the -local cardinalities of -finite spaces, it is useful to consider their image in Morava -theory. For , let be the Morava -theory associated with some formal group of height over , viewed as an object of . In particular, we have a (non-canonical) isomorphismChromatic Cardinality\nThe -category is -semiadditive by Theorem 5.3.1 in6, and hence we can consider cardinalities of -finite spaces in . The -typical height cardinality of a -finite space is defined to be For we can identify with , and so can recover the homotopy cardinality. For , let be the -adic free loop space of . It turns out that belongs to the subring and satisfies . Applying this inductively we see that for the -typical height cardinality in terms of the homotopy cardinality. If is a -space, then coincides with the ordinary loop space.\nQuestion\nHow can we show that when is a -space? Hint: First consider the universal examples . The following gives another family of examples of higher semiadditive -categories:Prop: is -semiadditive\nFor every the -category is -semiadditive.\nCategorical Cardinality\nLet and let . For every -finite space , the -semiadditive structure of gives rise to a functor . When , is given by taking the constant colimit on . Since preserves limits, and hence is -semiadditive, the same claim holds for .\nConversely, the -semiadditive structure on is given by taking limits of constant diagrams.(co)Cartesian -commutative Monoid Structure\nFor , since is freely generated from a point under -finite colimits, we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cocartesian structure. Dually, for , we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cartesian structure.\nThe full subcategory is closed under colimits, and in particular is -semiadditive, since the inclusion admits the right adjoint .We will explore the notion of semiadditive height, as well as its relation to other classical notions of height. The definition of height will depend on a choice of a prime , and a -typical version of -semiadditivity where we use -finite -spaces rather than all -finite spaces. -Spaces\nRecall that a space is a -space if and only if all its homotopy groups are -torsion (i.e. for each , and each , there exists such that ). When has finite homotopy groups, this implies that they are -groups (i.e. their order is a power of ).\n-Typical Semiadditivity\nLet be a prime and . We say that An -category is -typically -semiadditive if all -finite -spaces are -ambidextrous.\nA functor between such is -typically -semadditive if it preserves all -finite -space colimits (or equivalently limits).\nAn -monoidal -category for an -operad is -typically -semiadditively -monoidal if it is -typically -semiadditive and is compatible with -finite -space colimits (equivalently limits). Let denote the sub--category of -typically -semiadditive -categories and -typically -semiadditive functors.Prop: -Typical -Semiadditivity from Building Blocks\nLet . (1) An -category is -typically -semiadditive if and only if is -ambidextrous for all (2) For , a -semiadditive functor is -typically -semiadditive if and only if it preserves -(co)limits for all . Proof.\n(1) Since is an -finite -space for all , the only if direction is definitional. Conversely, let be an -finite -space. Since is -semiadditive, we are reduced to the case that is connected. Indeed, otherwise for connected -finite -spaces. Thenand can be given by and by iterating Kan extensions, so as is -semiadditive it suffices that the norm maps are equivalences.Now, since is connected, the Postnikov tower of can be refined to a tower of principal fibrationssuch that the fiber of each is of the form for some , since all connected -finite -spaces are -nilpotent.Since we can iterate Kan extensions, to show is -ambidextrous it suffices to show each is -ambidextrous, and since -ambidexterity is a fiber-wise condition, this follows from the fact that is -ambidextrous.(2) Analogously to (1), we can reduce to connected -finite -spaces, at which point we can take a tower of principal fibrations, so that commuting with -(co)limits follows from commuting with -(co)limits, which are equivalent to commuting with fiber-wise indexed (co)limits, i.e. -(co)limits.\nFor a -typical -semiadditive -category , the cardinalities for will play an important role in our definition of semiadditive height. The motivating example to consider in what follows is the following:-modules of -local Spectra\nFor , we have for all , where the case is interpreted using .\nWe now move to defining semiadditive height. This relies on the following notion of divisibility and completeness with respect to natural endomorphisms of the identity.Divisibility and Completeness\nLet and let be a natural endomorphism. An object is called: -divisible if is invertible\n-complete if for all -divisible We suggestively write for the full subcategories spanned by the -divisible and -complete objects, respectively.Semiadditive Height of Objects\nLet be a -typical -semiadditive -category and let . We define the -typical semiadditive height of as follows for : (1) We say if is -divisible\n(2) We say if is -complete\n(3) We say if and . Warning\nWhen is not -semiadditive, the notion of semiadditive height is not well-defined for all objects in . Indeed, we can only test an objects height being or if is to the semiadditivity of , so we can have objects which have height , and not have a finite defined height.\nIn particular, the statements and signify a certain property that satisfies, and is in general not a well-defined number which can be compared with .\nFor which is -semiadditive we write if and only if for all . By convention for all , and or if and only if .Height Let be a -semiadditive -category. Then an object is of height if and only if , the map obtained by is an equivalence, and of height if it is -complete.\nThe next result helps justify the inequality notation.Prop: Inequalities of Height\nLet be a -typical -semiadditive -category and let be some integers. Then for (1) If then (2) If then Proof.\nFor (1) it suffices by iterating that if for some , then .

Another motivation for this approach comes from the observation that a continuous map of spaces induces a geometric morphism of -topoi. In this way, such a morphism allows us to consider as a -category which carries the information of the original sheaf topos on along with topological properties of the continuous map inducing it.Throughout will be an -topos, which is to say a left exact and accessible localization of a presheaf -category for some small -category , where is the -category of -groupoids.There are three main presentations of -categories internal to the -topos :\nThe simplicial perspective\nThe sheaf perspective\nThe fibered perspective\nWe write for the -spine, which can be viewed as a simplicial -groupoid , and we write for the walking equivalence. We will often use the algebraic morphism in the adjunction to identify simplicial -groupoids, such as these, with simplicial objects in .-category (Simplicial Definition)\nA -category is a simplicial object that is internally local with respect to (Segal conditions) and (univalence). We write for the full subcategory spanned by -categories. A -groupoid is a simplicial object which is internally local with respect to . We write for the full subcategory spanned by -groupoids.\nThe -groupoids are precisely the essential image of the diagonal embedding so that . The statement that is internally local with respect to a certain morphism in means that the canonical map is internally right orthogonal to the morphisms, or equivalently that the induced mapis an equivalence. The inclusion preserves filtered colimits and admits a left adjoint preserving finite products. In particular, is presentable and an exponential ideal in , so in particular is cartesian closed. We can define bifunctors\n(Functor -category) (Powering) (Tensoring) which fit into 2-variable adjunctions In particular, evaluating the left equivalence at the terminal -category we have , so that gives rise to a -enrichment of , or in other words an -categorical enhancement.\nUsing our previously defined bifunctor, we have a natural fully-faithful embedding which factors through an equivalenceThus, -categories are equivalent to sheaves of -categories . When is a copre-sheaf -topos, we have a natural equivalenceThus, the current perspective generalizes the notion of paramaterized -categories. Additionally, via the un/straightening correspondence we obtain an embedding .For a -category and , we write for the -category of local sections over , and write for the restriction along a map in . One can also interpret as the complete Segal space whose space of -morphisms is given by the -groupoid .For a geometric morphism with left adjoint , is given by restriction along , while is given by left Kan extension along . If admits a further left adjoint , then this is just precomposition with .Explication: Objects and Morphisms in -Categories\nUsing the two-variable adjunctions introduced previously, one obtains equivalences for all , , and (with the diagonal embedding left implicit). Combining this with a previous remark we see that Let's see some examples in the sheaf perspective:-groupoid\nEvery object of defines a -category via the Yoneda embedding The -categories of this form are called -groupoids.\nThe -category of -groupoids\nSince is a topos, the functor associated to the cartesian fibration (i.e. ) preserves limits and thus defines a -category denoted by , and refer to it as the -category of -groupoids.\nLet's now move to describing internal (co)limits in the parameterized setting.-colimits\nLet be an -category and let be a class of morphisms in closed under base change (i.e. base-changes of morphisms in exist and have output again in ). Given a functor , we say that admits -colimits or is -cocomplete if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) For every in , the functor admits a left adjoint <br>(2) For every pullback square in <img src=\"images/svg-cache/232d8cfa02809dc47e80606783a00644.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nwith , the Beck-Chevalley transformation of functors is an equivalence.\nExplication\nIf is terminal, then the functor having a left adjoint is analogous to the diagonal having a left adjoint, which occurs precisely when has -shaped colimits. In general we can think of as a kind of left Kan extension. The Beck-Chevalley transformation then says that left Kan extensions formed in this way are preserved under base-change.\nDually, if has a right adjoint such that the corresponding Beck-Chevalley transformations are equivalences, then we say admits -limits.Often we will add the assumption that is an -topos, and that the class in is local in the sense that a morphism is in whenever there exists an effective epimorphism in such that each of the base change maps is in .Preserving -colimits\nLet be -cocomplete. A natural transformation is said to preserve -colimits if for every morphism in the Beck-Chevalley map is an equivalence (we also say is -cocontinuous).\nExample: Base Case\nWhen , global sections defines an equivalence , with inverse given by sending to . For , a cat then has -colimits if and only if we can perform left Kan extension for space-indexed functors into along morphisms in .\nIn addition to groupoid indexed colimits defined in this fashion, we will also be interested in fiberwise colimits:Fiberwise Colimits\nLet be a (non-parameterized) -category. We say that a -category has fiberwise -shaped colimits if the category has -shaped colimits for every and the restriction functor preserves -shaped colimits for each in .\nWe say a functor of -categories with fiberwise -shaped colimits preserves fiberwise -shaped colimits if it preserves -shaped colimits pointwise.<br>Combining these notions we will say a -category is cocomplete if it is -cocomplete in the parameterized sense and moeover fiberwise cocomplete. Analogously to the classical theory, if is a cocomplete -category, then the inclusion of constant diagrams has a left adjoint for every and every small -category (c.f.

We say is presentable if it is fiberwise presentable and additionally satisfies the following two conditions: (1) (Left Adjoints) For all in , the restriction has left adjoint (2) (Left Base Change) For every , with pullback cospan , the Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence. If are presentable -categories, we say -functor preserves (parameterized) colimits if the following two properties are satisfied:\n(1) For every , the functor preserves small colimits;\n(2) For every in , the Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence\nNote that in the left Base change condition, passing to right adjoints gives that the other Beck-Chevalley transformation is also an equivalence by uniqueness of adjoints and the fact that and .

This gives the structure of a symmetric monoidal -category whose monoidal unit is . In particular, the classical formula carries over to giveThe universal property satisfied by this parameterized monoidal structure can be expressed by the equivalencewhich in particular implies that preserves colimits.Presentably Symmetric Monoidal -Category\nA presentably symmetric monoidal -category is a commutative algebra object in the symmetric monoidal -category .\nNote that we have an embedding so that a symmetric monoidal -category is presentably symmetric monoidal if and only if it is presentable, and the tensor product -functor is bi-cocontinuous. This can be expressed by the following two non-parameterized conditions:\n(Fiberwise presentably symmetric monoidal) For each , the tensor product functor is bi-cocontinuous\n(Left Projection Formula) For each in and all objects and , the exchange morphism is an equivalence\nEquivalently, this can be expressed as a limit-preserving functor such that the symmetric monoidal restriction functors admit left adjoints that satisfy base change and satisfy the left projection formula.To continue the preliminaries needed for twisted ambidexterity, the next step is to understand the algebra and module theory associated to the symmetric monoidal -category . Before diving into this material we will review some basic aspects of the theory of -operads, and the theory algebras over algebraic patterns more generally. <br>Bastiaan Cnossen. “Twisted Ambidexterity in Equivariant Homotopy Theory: Two Approaches.” Phd, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, 2024. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11811/11281\" target=\"_self\">https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11811/11281</a>.<a href=\"#fnref-1-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Cnossen, Bastiaan, Tobias Lenz, and Sil Linskens. “Parametrized (Higher) Semiadditivity and the Universality of Spans.” arXiv:2403.07676.

What does this mean?\nIf is a monoidal -category and is an -category enriched in , we write for the -mapping object of . When is closed, we write for . For every -category we write . The importance of -finite maps and spaces lies in their use as indexing -categories for diagrams that we are interested in comparing limits and colimits of. Specifically, the in -semiadditivity indicates the size of the -finite spaces for which we have norm mapswhich are equivalences. Let's begin with the basic notion of ambidexterity in chromatic homotopy theory.Ambidexterity of -finite Maps\nLet . A -finite map is called: weakly -ambidextrous if it is an equivalence, or is -ambidextrous\n-ambidextrous if it is weakly -ambidextrous, admits all -limits and -colimits, and the norm map is an equivalence. A -finite map, i.e. an equivalence, is always -ambidextrous. If is -finite, then the diagonalis -finite and the ambidexterity of allows in turn the definition of .The property of being -ambidextrous is preserved by pullbacks and determined by its fibers. Since the fibers of the diagonal are path spaces of , is weakly -ambidextrous if and only if the path spaces of are -ambidextrous. This begins the inductive construction since the path-space reduces from an -finite space to an -finite space.Prop: Characterization of -Ambidextrous Morphism\nLet be an -category and let be a -finite map. The map is -ambidextrous if and only if the following hold: is weakly -ambidextrous admits all -limits and -colimits\nEither preserves all -colimits or preserves all -limits. Proof Idea.\nFrom the discussion above, we can assume wlog that . The forward implication is immediate due to the norm equivalence, so it suffices to show that if (1)-(3) hold, then the norm map is an equivalence. ***Prop: Closure of Ambidexterity under -category constructions\nLet be an -category and let be a -finite -ambidextrous space. The space is also -ambidextrous for (1) (2) for an -category\n(3) containing the final object and closed under -limits for all and (4) containing the initial object and closed under -colimits for all and . Note: Here is the -fold based loop space at .The first two properties are classical, while the last two are dual and follow from the inductive construction of norm maps.Important\nThe main feature of ambidexterity is that it allows us to integrate families of morphisms in . That is, given a -ambidextrous map and , we have a map which can be given by the composite When we can think of an element of as a map , and as the sum of over points of . Explicitly, the identification of mapping spaces comes from the equivalences Intuition for Induction: For a space and a diagram , to specify a norm map is to specify a homotopy coherently compatible collection of morphisms , for . always provides a family of candidates for these maps, , but a-priori there is no coherent choice for them which can be made. But, if we can integrate over the spaces , we can just takeWhen is constant on some object , then the Norm map is the same as a map of spaces , where the above construction specializes to .Important\nThe initial claim comes from the natural equivalences where is the whiskering of , while is the whiskering of . Thus, we have a natural equivalence Thus, the data of a map is equivalent to the data of a map of simplicial sets such that and .\nFurther, in the case when is the constant functor at some . In this case, the data of a map is equivalent to the data of a map of simplicial sets such that . A natural family of such transformations is then a map of simplicial sets such that .\nMore generally, if has all -shaped (co)limits, so that we have functors , then the natural equivalences we want are given by using adjoints and (co)continuity of the diagonal:Thus, a family of norms is equivalent to a natural transformation .Similarly, if has all -shaped (co)limits for , so that exist, then we have natural maps<br>where is the natural equivalence coming from , and the center map uses the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories\" data-href=\"Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/calculus-of-mates-for-infinity-categories.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">mate calculus</a><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories\" data-href=\"Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/calculus-of-mates-for-infinity-categories.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">mate calculus</a> on this transformation to obtain . If this Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence, then it follows that the data of a norm is equivalent to the data of a natural transformation . Since the square in which appears is a homotopy pullback square of -groupoids, and hence we can assume without loss of generality that is a Kan fibration, the square is exact, and hence it satisfies the Beck-Chevalley condition (c.f. Chapter 13 of<a data-footref=\"4\" href=\"#fn-4-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>).Inductive Approach: If is an -finite space, then the path spaces are -finite. Thus, if inductively we have invertible canonical norm maps for all -finite spaces , then we obtain a canonical way to integrate -finite families of morphisms, which allows us to define norm maps for all -finite spaces. Whether all these new norm maps are isomorphisms is now a property, which if holding let's us continue the induction:\n() We define every -category to be -semiadditive. Recall that the -finite spaces are the contractible ones, and the canonical norm map is hence an equivalence, being equivalent to the identity transformation on . This just says we can canonically sum a one point family of maps.\n() The only non-contractible -finite space is . The associated norm map is the unique map from the initial object to the terminal object of , which always exists. Thus, is -semiadditive if and only if it is pointed. This allows integration of empty families of morphisms, which is to say that for any , we get a canonical zero map given by the composition () Let be an -finite space, and suppose is -semiadditive. Then in particular we have an equivalence , which corresponds to a wrong-way co-unit and a wrong-way unit , so that we can define the map which from the discussion preceding the induction is equivalent to a norm map , which is given by where the Beck-Chevalley transformation can be written as the composite As a first example, in the step is equivalent to a set, so we can replace by a set if necessary. Then is precisely a set of objects in indexed by those in , and is the matrix of objects with and when , and similarly is the matrix of objects with and with . On the other hand, and are matrices with constant rows and constant columns, respectively. The compositeis given precisely by the matrix of maps with , while for , is the unique composite through the zero object. The norm map is then the compositeAs a second example, if we're doing the step with a connected -finite space, so that for some finite group , then . Write for the unique map to the point. Further, and for are the homotopy orbits and fixed points, respectively, while for is an object with trivial action, is given -action with trivial right action component, and similarly for . Finally, if is a - object, then is the -space given by taking homotopy orbits with respect to the first factor, and is the -space given by taking homotopy fixed points with respect to the first factor. Now, the compositeis given by summing over orbits. Finally, the first map is given by sending the orbits of a -space to the homotopy fixed points of the homotopy orbits with trivial action, and the last map is given by sending the the homotopy fixed points of the homotopy orbits of the original -object viewed itself as a -object with trivial action, to the homotopy fixed points of the underlying object. Thus, the resulting norm map is precisely the classical orbit map:given informally by .Integrating the identity morphism yields the notion of -cardinality.-cardinality\nLet and let be a -ambidextrous map. We have a natural transformation given by the composition For a -ambidextrous space , we write and call the -cardinality of .\nNote that for a given object , is exactly .Motivating Example\nLet be a semiadditive -category. For a finite set , viewed as an -finite space, the operation is simply the multiplication by the natural number which is the usual cardinality of .\nNote: For a -ambidextrous space , the -limits and -colimits in are canonically isomorphic, which implies the following:Prop: Preservation of Limits and Colimits for Ambidextrous Spaces\nLet , and let be a - and -ambidextrous space.

For each point , we have a homotopy fiber sequence where is also -finite, by definition of -finite maps. Thus, looking at the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for each , we see that is also -truncated, has finitely many path components, and has all homotopy groups begin finite, completing the proof.\nWe extend to by defining for the -categorywith limit computed in .

For each , there is a unique fully-faithful and -semiadditive functor whose composition with the forgetful functor is the Yoneda embedding.\nHere a functor between -semiadditive -categories is said to be -semiadditive if it preserves -finite limits.Proof.<br>\nTaking in <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Ambidexterity and Height - Semiadditivity > ^115deb\" data-href=\"Ambidexterity and Height - Semiadditivity#^115deb\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/ambidexterity/csy-papers/ambidexterity-and-height-semiadditivity.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">the universality of m-commutative monoids</a><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Ambidexterity and Height - Semiadditivity > ^115deb\" data-href=\"Ambidexterity and Height - Semiadditivity#^115deb\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/ambidexterity/csy-papers/ambidexterity-and-height-semiadditivity.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">the universality of m-commutative monoids</a>, we see that the ordinary Yoneda embeddinglifts essentially uniquely to a fully-faithful -finite limit preserving functorCurrying we obtain a functorlifting , and hence giving each mapping space a canonical -commutative monoid structure.Before moving into more technical work, let's review some examples of -semiadditive -categories and the behaviour of cardinalities of -finite spaces in them. We have the following universal example of an -semiadditive -category:Universal Case\nFor the symmetric monoidal -category of spans is the universal -semiadditive -category. For every , we have Note that is the set of isomorphism classes of -finite spaces with semiring structure given by Similarly, is the universal presentable -semiadditive -category. The Yoneda embedding induces a fully-faithful -semiadditive symmetric monoidal functor taking an -finite space to the free -commutative monoid on .\nHomotopy Cardinality\nFor a -finite space , the homotopy cardinality of is the rational number We say an -category is semirational if it is -semiadditive (i.e. -finite spaces are -ambidextrous, which are contractible, empty, and discrete spaces) and for each , multiplication by is invertible in (e.g. or ). Here multiplication by on an object is given by the cardinality , which is the composite A semirational -category which admits all -finite colimits is automatically -semiadditive, and for every -finite space , we have that its cardinality is its homotopy cardinality: This comes from the fact that the cardinality is additive, and for every fiber sequence of -finite spaces where is connected, . In Chromatic homotopy theory we often come across examples of -semiadditive -categories of higher height. For a given prime , and , let be the Morava -theory spectrum of height at the prime . We have that the localizations and are -semiadditive. For , , and the cardinalities recover the homotopy cardinality. Similarly, since is -local for all , if is a -finite space whose homotopy groups have cardinality prime to , then the -local cardinality of coincides with the homotopy cardinality for all by the previous example. However, this does not hold in general for -finite spaces whose cardinality is not prime to .To study the -local cardinalities of -finite spaces, it is useful to consider their image in Morava -theory. For , let be the Morava -theory associated with some formal group of height over , viewed as an object of . In particular, we have a (non-canonical) isomorphismChromatic Cardinality\nThe -category is -semiadditive by Theorem 5.3.1 in6, and hence we can consider cardinalities of -finite spaces in . The -typical height cardinality of a -finite space is defined to be For we can identify with , and so can recover the homotopy cardinality. For , let be the -adic free loop space of . It turns out that belongs to the subring and satisfies . Applying this inductively we see that for the -typical height cardinality in terms of the homotopy cardinality. If is a -space, then coincides with the ordinary loop space.\nQuestion\nHow can we show that when is a -space? Hint: First consider the universal examples . The following gives another family of examples of higher semiadditive -categories:Prop: is -semiadditive\nFor every the -category is -semiadditive.\nCategorical Cardinality\nLet and let . For every -finite space , the -semiadditive structure of gives rise to a functor . When , is given by taking the constant colimit on . Since preserves limits, and hence is -semiadditive, the same claim holds for .\nConversely, the -semiadditive structure on is given by taking limits of constant diagrams.(co)Cartesian -commutative Monoid Structure\nFor , since is freely generated from a point under -finite colimits, we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cocartesian structure. Dually, for , we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cartesian structure.\nThe full subcategory is closed under colimits, and in particular is -semiadditive, since the inclusion admits the right adjoint .Recall that for a symmetric monoidal -category with subcategory spanned by dualizable objects, every admits a trace or Euler characteristic given by the compositewhere the symmetrizer in the center can be thought of as the analogue of our norm map in this context. For example, if , and , then is the Euler characteristic of the finite space (here finite is in the sense of -compactness, which is equivalent to being weakly equivalent to a finite CW complex).On the other hand, in the context of -ambidexterity for a -finite map and a (co)complete -category (or at least finitely complete with sufficient limits and colimits so the following adjunctions exist), we look at the adjunctions where is pullback, is left Kan extension along , and is right Kan extension along . When is the point, becomes the diagonal, , and . The Norm map is then a natural comparison map (which need not always exist)which in the case of -ambidexterity of is an equivalence, along with all the associated norm maps for diagonal of . The cardinality for a -ambidextrous map then defines an analogue of the trace in the case of symmetric monoidal -categoriesFor example, if is the infinity category of spectra, then we can use the natural equivalence<br>(c.f. <a data-href=\"Universality of Multiplicative Infinite Loop Space Machines (Gepner, Groth, Nikolaus)#^5eab9d\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/homotopy-algebras/universality-of-multiplicative-infinite-loop-space-machines-(gepner,-groth,-nikolaus).html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">Universality of Multiplicative Infinite Loop Space Machines (Gepner, Groth, Nikolaus) &gt; ^5eab9d</a><a data-href=\"Universality of Multiplicative Infinite Loop Space Machines (Gepner, Groth, Nikolaus)#^5eab9d\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/homotopy-algebras/universality-of-multiplicative-infinite-loop-space-machines-(gepner,-groth,-nikolaus).html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Universality of Multiplicative Infinite Loop Space Machines (Gepner, Groth, Nikolaus) &gt; ^5eab9d</a>) to observe that being cocontinuous means we can write it as , so that Thus, for any -finite map, the -cardinality of corresponds to an integer, where for , is given by the compositewhere we're identifying with the integer value.To begin let's consider the case of a finite group so that is a -finite space, and take for a commutative unital ring . Then is the category of -valued -representations for a commutative ring . The map is given by sending an -module to the trivial representation associated to it. On the other hand, sends a -representation to the -module of -orbits, and sends a -representation to the -module of -fixed points. We then have a natural norm mapThe kernel of this map consists of those -orbits such that , while the image always at least contains . The norm map fits in the Tate cohomology groups which are defined byRecall here that , and that are the right derived functors of the fixed point functor, while , and are the left derived functors. We can also describe the group cohomology as the cohomology of the cochain complex associated to the simplicial -module , with face operators given by multiplying arguments internally, or acting on the left/right (with right action being trivial), and degeneracies given by inserting identities.Example\nConsider the case of and . Then is just multiplication by , implying that but .\nExample\nIf is a commutative ring and is a group with , then is multiplication by , and hence is an isomorphism. In particular, the norm map for any constant representation is an isomorphism.\nExample\nIf , , and with the action given by the inclusion , then is the space of homotopy orbits, while is the space of homotopy fixed points, so we would never have the norm map being an isomorphism.\nLet be a finite group and let be the unique -finite map of spaces.

Equivalently, and , where here we're using that is tensored and cotensored over , being complete and cocomplete. Explicitly, for a spectrum , is the -equivariant mapping spectrum and with diagonal action. In this situation the Tate construction measures the defect for being -ambidextrous:Here for a -module, the Tate construction has homotopy groups recovering the Tate cohomology <br>Carmeli, S., Schlank, T.M., Yanovski, L.: Ambidexterity and Height, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13089\" target=\"_self\">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13089</a>, (2020)<a href=\"#fnref-1-37f2fc8ece890321\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Cnossen, Bastiaan, Tobias Lenz, and Sil Linskens. “Parametrized (Higher) Semiadditivity and the Universality of Spans.” arXiv:2403.07676.

However, structures such as -categories, or more generally bicategories (and their higher dimensional analogues), are often insufficient for encoding a number of important abstract constructions prevalent in category theory. Although notions such as adjunctions and equivalences can be defined purely algebraically internal to any bicategory, the naive definition of fully-faithfulness and of Kan extensions often fails to encapsulate the right properties in enriched settings. This failure stems from the inability to discuss representability, or equivalently yoneda constructions, internal to a general bicategory.\nIn this talk we will provide a brief introduction to the framework of formal category theory via pro-arrow equipments which fixes this issue. After this brief introduction we will explore how this work generalizes to the construction of a formal theory of -categories due to Riehl and Verity (with further recent work by Ruit) which provides a suitable definition of Kan extensions internal to an arbitrary -cosmos (and hence any well-behaved model of -categories).\nThis note accompanies a brief talk on the formal theory of -category theory at the UIUC Graduate Homotopy Theory Seminar, motivated primarily by the work of Riehl and Verity on -cosmoi in 24 and 5, as well as the classical theory of formal category theory via pro-arrow equipments discussed by Verity in6 with additional extensions by Shulman in3. Although this note does not cover the theory of pro-arrow equipments internal to -categories, as constructed by Ruit in1, Ruit's work is a large motivator for the speaker's interest in this area.As discussed at length in a number of the above sources, one of the main goals of formal category theory is to be able to abstract and encapsulate the essential aspects of category theory in its many guises, such as enriched category theory and fibrant category theory. A first attempt at this can be seen in the structure of -categories which are rich enough to formalize notions of adjunctions and equivalences. However, it was found that such structures alone were insufficient for the development of a great number of important categorical concepts and tools. For instance, one can formulate a definition of Kan extensions internal to a -category, but this would only produce the naive definition of Kan extensions rather than the more prolific and useful notion of pointwise Kan extensions. Similarly, although one can attempt to representably define fully-faithfulness of functors, often this will produce the wrong notion, for example when considering enriched concepts.But why should we care about pointwise Kan extensions over the naive notion that can be defined internal to any -category? Some motivation from homotopy theory is that pointwise Kan extensions are needed to obtain functorial derived functors, while the result that Quillen adjunctions descend to adjunctions on the level of homotopy categories also relies on this pointwise (or more strictly absolute) notion of Kan extensions.It turns out that the thing missing from these structures is exactly a theory which can internally discuss the notion of representability and yoneda embeddings. Generalizing, one can ask that we can encapsulate a suitable notion of profunctors , which are classically represented by bifunctors in ordinary category theory, or in a -enriched context. The canonical example of such a functor (resp. -functor) is given by the hom-bifunctor\nfor a category , which is adjoint to the yoneda embedding . In this note we aim to provide a brief intuition for structures that behave like profunctors more generally, and how we can extend them to -categorical contexts.Pro-arrow equipments are an additional structure on a bicategory introduced by Wood, and studied further by Verity in6, in order to encapsulate the structure of profunctors present in the canonical bicategory .Equipments on Bicategories\nAn equipment on a bicategory consists of another bicategory along with an identity on objects bifunctor\nsuch that for any -cell in , admits a right adjoint in . An equipment is called a pro-arrow equipment if in addition is locally fully faithful.\nHowever, we will not explore these definitions, as given here, much further in this note, instead preferring Verity's reformulation in terms of the theory of double categories which we now briefly review. For this perspective we will primarily follow Shulman's exposition in3, where he refers to these structures as framed bicategories. These structures have important applications outside of just the formal theory of category theory, such as in the study of parametrized spectra and in our -categorical setting to come, parametrized -categories which provide a way of studying enriched -categories.As in3 and4 we will be restricting to what in double-categorical literature is often referred to as pseudo double categories when speaking of double categories in this note. Intuitively, one can think of a double category as a pair of a vertical category and a horizontal category with squares relating their morphisms such that the composition in the horizontal category need not be strict (and as we will see later with virtual double categories, may not even be defined).Double Category\nA double category is an internal category object in :\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/30a391227429ec19f371004b2a58490c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nequipped with natural isomorphisms\nsatisfying appropriate coherence diagrams, and which are identities under whiskering with or .\nHere we write in diagrammatic ordering, suggesting our emphasis on the perspective that pro-arrows in a double category represent modules.<br>Double Category of Squares in a -category\nLet be a -category. Then we have a natural double category whose category is the underlying category of , and whose category has as objects -cells in and as morphisms squares\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/a1397f558f1e936317a5a39db8998eec.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nHorizontal and vertical composition is given by pasting -cells.\n<br>Double Category of Modules\nLet be the double category with , the category of (unital) rings, and the category with objects bimodules and morphisms bimodule homomorphisms.

Horizontal composition on profunctors is given by the co-end formula\nwhere on the right is standard tensor on given by cartesian product, or more general for , is the chosen tensor in .\nAn important piece in the theory of pro-arrow equipments, especially when we inevitably move on to the theory of equipments as a descriptor for modules between -categories, is the notion of fibered categories. Briefly, a Grothendieck fibration between categories is a functor such that for every and every morphism in , there exists a lift making the diagram<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/a0328383eeebc039fc49147bc28cd0cc.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">a pullback in . Intuitively this says that universally lifts factorizations through for maps comin from . Dually, an opfibration is a functor such that for every and in , there exists a lift making the diagram<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/c5b1fafbf3c4c10e3c9c09a231a65c09.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">a pullback in .Two important results for fibrations which are relevant to this note are their correspondence to pseudo-functors under the Grothendieck construction and the relation between fibrations and op-fibrations in terms of adjunctions in the total category.Theorem: Grothendieck Construction [Shu,3.8]\nGiven a category , we have an equivalence\nwhere the category on the left has as objects Grothendieck fibrations and as morphisms maps in the slice which preserve cartesian morphisms, and the category on the right has as objects pseudo-functors and as morphisms strong transformations, where is viewed as a discrete bicategory.\nAdjoint Relation Between Fibrations and Op-Fibrations [Shu,3.9]\nA fibration is an opfibration if and only if for every in , the natural functor has a left adjoint .\nProof.\nLet be a map in . Note that by the classification of cartesian lifts applied to identity fillings, we have a natural bijection between maps in lying over and maps in . On the other hand, the dual property for opcartesian lifts gives a bijection between maps over and maps in . In other words, we have the natural bijection\nso the existence of opcartesian lifts is equivalent to the existence of right adjoints, and vice-versa if we start with an opfibration. *** In addition to the existence of pro-arrows, which are our horizontals arrows in any double category, we want suitable assumptions on our double categories so that they behave like profunctors in order to encapsulate an appropriate theory of kan extensions. This behaviour is encapsulated in the language of fibrations reviewed above.Pro-arrow Equipment\nA double category is said to be a pro-arrow equipment on is a bifibration.\nThis structure equivalently encapsulates the idea of base change, which is terminology of bimodules instead of pro-arrows when talking about double categories, and in particular pro-arrow equipments. Let's unpack what it means for to be a bifibration. Since such a functor being a bifibration is equivalent to it being a fibration or a opfibration (c.f. [Shu,4.1]) we'll just consider the case of fibration. Explicitly we're saying that any cup<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/5af4c9e20da1f6eaa5dd6a6d5902850a.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">can be universally filled to a square<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/992ed02e696f537977636947ef098ba3.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">in the sense that any rectangle uniquely factors through it:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/170dce4cff2d7097a508c81b97a85dc2.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">This structure is equivalent to the existence of companions and conjoints for all vertical morphisms in the double category (c.f. [Shu, 4.1]).<br>Companions and Conjoints\nLet be a double category and a vertical arrow. A companion for is a horizontal arrow together with squares\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/bf8fc72b27e76764e759bd9b0cb4ae6c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nsatisfying\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/2f5c9d204389700224fa70358ed99369.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nand\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/513e8205b13f38d3eb396acc9b98229c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nA conjoint of is a horizontal morphism together with dual squares and relations.\nIt is easy to see that companions and conjoints arise from the characterizing property of being a fibration and opfibration, respectively. Explicitly, for is a vertical morphism, then , where is the identity at in under horizontal composition. Similarly, . Going the other way, a filling as above the definition can be precisely obtained from companions and conjoints as the composite, or tensor, , while the dual filling for opfibrations, , is given by . These are the structures that will allow us to formalize and generalize weighted colimits, fully-faithfulness, and (pointwise) Kan extensions internally to a pro-arrow equipment.Double Category of Modules is a pro-arrow equipment, where for ring homomorphisms and as well as a bimodule , is exactly the bimodule obtained by restriction. Equivalently, . The previous formulas also tells us that this forces for a bimodule that\nwhich is the usual base-change formula for bimodules.\nDouble Category of Profunctors is a pro-arrow equipment where for functors and , and a profunctor , its pullback is given by the composite\nOn the other hand, if is another profunctor, then is given by pointwise left Kan extension: Observe that if is any functor, then the profunctor under adjunction corresponds to a functor given by sending to .

By the universal property of this corresponds to an accessible functor\nand as the reader might observe, this gives us an adjoint pair . This observation is actually a general phenomenon of pro-arrow equipments.Adjoint Pair of Pro-arrows [Shu, 5.3]\nIf is a vertical arrow in a pro-arrow equipment , then internal to the horizontal bicategory .\nProof.\nWe can explicit construct the unit and co-unit of this adjunction as the composites<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/eaa254f8db13993d9a08958f7b615031.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">with the triangle identities following from the defining identities for conjoints and companions. *** This can be viewed as a special case of the following more general result.Preservation of Adjoint Pairs under Base Change\nLet be an adjoint pair in , with and . If and are vertical morphisms, then .\nProof.\nObserve that\nso we have the composite<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/3bb02aa311b80e1476446c5c79275ef1.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">where the result now follows from the fact that adjoints compose in an arbitrary bicategory. *** However, if we go with the original philosophy of pro-arrow equipments we should be thinking of the horizontal arrows as a tool for doing category theory in the -category . A key result in this direction is the following lemma describing how we can translate between horizontal and vertical composites using companions and conjoints.<br>Central Lemma\nGiven a pro-arrow equipment , there is a natural bijection between squares of the following forms\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/1d0305702aa561a2d1c4fa997f67f023.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nThis equivalence is given by pasting with the squares defining companions and conjoints. This immediately allows us to realize an adjunction in the vertical -category , which takes the form<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/feef4257753b47f40f611cbee5ddc43c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">can equivalently be phrased as squares<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/f3cd85588d98af73893ca2bdda0c61a6.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">Using our analogy with profunctors we can think of as representing the hom , while as . Tracing through how the triangle identities transform shows that we exactly obtain squares which are vertical isomorphisms, given a formal correspondence between internal and hom characterizations of adjunctions.With this analogy in mind we can give the following definition of fully-faithfulness:<br>Fully-Faithful Vertical Morphism in Pro-arrow Equipment\nA vertical morphism in a pro-arrow equipment is said to be fully-faithful if and only if the canonical square\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/37ccdbbdf071e29c99afad39094b66ce.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nis an isomorphism in .\nFinally, before moving into our -categorical story lets discuss the main advertised benefit of the use of pro-arrow equipments in formal category theory: the ability to describe the right kind of Kan extensions. We will do this through the language of weighted (co)limits. In the context of pro-arrow equipments the pro-arrows serve as our weights, while the vertical arrows are what we're taking (co)limits of. In order to define this for convenience we could require more structure on our double category , which classically corresponds to the requirement that we have enough (right) extensions and lifts. Explicitly, we may require that the bicategory is closed, which is to say its composition sits in a triple of adjunctions\nThe first equivalence is the statement that we have enough right lifts while the equivalence with the second hom is the statement that we have enough right extensions. General properties of adjoints then imply the for , , and ,\nHowever, we can also define it in terms of the universal property for local right extensions and lifts.<br>Weighted (co)limits in a Pro-arrow Equipment\nLet and be a vertical and horizontal arrow in a pro-arrow equipment . A vertical arrow is a -weighted colimit of if its conjoint represents -cones under , or in other words is a right lifting of the conjoint along . Explicitly, this means that we have a square such that any square\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/00e5ffc66a15c2a0b5e1f8fefedffca7.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nfactors through via a square . In taking with hom object the monoidal unit, we obtain the usual definition of a weighted colimit in a -category for a -diagram . Indeed, in this case a weight is the same as a -functor , while the universal property says that we have a natural isomorphism\nWe can finally give the right definition of (pointwise) left and right Kan extensions in this context.Pointwise Kan Extension\nIf and are vertical arrows in , then the pointwise left Kan extension of along , if it exists, is the colimit of weighted by the conjoint .\nLet's unpack this definition in the context of our above work. Explicitly, this says that a pointwise left Kan extension of along should be a vertical arrow together with a universal square<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/87e039abdfa98ff7d238709743d25390.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\"><br>Using <a data-href=\"An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules#^9faa11\" href=\"board-talks/topology-seminar/an-introduction-to-formal-(infinity-)category-theory-via-modules.html#^9faa11\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules &gt; ^9faa11</a><a data-href=\"An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules#^9faa11\" href=\"board-talks/topology-seminar/an-introduction-to-formal-(infinity-)category-theory-via-modules.html#^9faa11\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules &gt; ^9faa11</a> we can rephrase this as a square<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/40e9067bde50a6da74c38562706f3995.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which is the usual description of a left Kan extension, except now the weighted colimit requirement has encoded the correct universal property to ensure that this Kan extension is pointwise.Explicitly, if with a complete and cocomplete monoidal closed category, then for -functors and , a left Kan extension of along (if it exists) is a -functor together with a universal -natural transformation\nor after adjunction, since is (co)complete and closed, a -natural isomorphism\nwhich is the standard definition of a -enriched pointwise left Kan extension.Main takeaway: In order to define a formal notion of weighted colimits, fully-faithfulness, or pointwise Kan extensions, one needs a formal theory encoding representability internal to your structure.Now that we're more familiar with the classical theory of formal category theory in terms of pro-arrow equipments we can move on to the formal category theory of -categories. In this section we will begin by introducing the notion -cosmos due to Riehl and Verity7 before introducing the necessary language of (co)cartesian fibrations5 in order to introduce modules between -categories4. Finally, we will conclude with a brief discussion of how these modules between -categories let us encode Kan extensions in -cosmoi.This note will contain only details of relevance and interest to the current topic on -cosmoi. For a more complete description we refer to Riehl and Verity's text7. We will also not delve into the details of the quasi-categorical theory or provide definitions of such concepts here.Morally -cosmoi aim to describe the mathematical universe in which -categories live, rather than prescribing to a particular model of -categories. To those familiar with the model category literature you may notice that -cosmoi can be realized as a kind of enriched category of fibrant objects.-Cosmos\nAn -cosmos is a category enriched over the full subcategory of quasi-categories, together with a class of morphisms called isofibrations (denoted ) such that (Completeness) in the simplicially enriched sense possesses a terminal object,\nsmall products,\npullbacks of isofibrations,\nlimits of countable towers of isofibrations,\ncotensors with simplicial sets (Isofibrations) The class of isofibrations contains all isomorphisms and all maps (i.e. all objects are fibrant), while being closed under: composition,\nproduct,\npullback,\ninverse limits of towers, and\nLeibniz cotensors with monomorphisms of simplicial sets (i.e. mimicking the notion of a closed model structure), Isofibrations are also representably defined in the sense that if is an isofibration and is any object,\nis an isofibration of quasi-categories.\nMoving forward we will write for an abstract -cosmos. If the reader wishes they can have in mind that is the -cosmos of quasi-categories[^7, 1.2.10], where isofibrations are isofibrations of quasi-categories (i.e. inner fibrations that lift along boundary inclusions into the nerve of the free living isomorphism), or even the -cosmos of Kan complexes[^7, 1.2.12].An important construction we will need when considering modules between -categories is that of sliced -cosmoi.Sliced -Cosmos[^7, 1.2.22]\nFor , the sliced -cosmos consists of objects: isofibrations functor spaces: from to defined by pullback isofibrations: commutative triangles with cone point and all legs isofibrations\nTerminal object , and products given by pullback Pullbacks and limits of towers of isofibrations created by Simplicial cotensor of with given by the pullback Additionally, for those familiar with the essential role Kan complexes play in the quasi-categorical model of -categories, it won't be surprising that an analogous class of objects in a general -cosmos will play an essential role in formal -category theory, particularly when discussing modules.Discrete -Category\nAn -category is said to be discrete if for all , is a Kan complex.\nWe can think of discrete -categories as generalizations of -groupoids as they can be equivalently characterized by the condition that all morphisms are isomorphisms[^7, 1.2.27], which is encoded by the statement that\nis a trivial isofibration.Module between -Categories\nA module from to in is a two-sided isofibration which is discrete as an object of and such that is cocartesian and is cartesian.\nThis modules will take the place of our pro-arrows in a suitable generalization of pro-arrow equipments to the setting of the -cosmos . In order to act as pro-arrows in an equipment we need that modules are suitably stable under base-change in the following sense.<br>Basechange of a Module [^7, 7.4.5]\nIf is a module from to and and are a pair of functors, then the pullback defines a module <img src=\"images/svg-cache/cb95f0f972a326785909b7760da0c67b.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nOur prime example of modules will be those obtained from the comma category construction. Namely, the arrow -category is a module, implying that for any co-span , the comma -category :<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/8c3bd474a691ce6bafcff7e1f865f553.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">where is used to indicate that it is a module from to .Now that we have our modules, or pro-arrows, we want to define a double category which will be our pro-arrow equipment we can do formal -category theory internal to. However, as we will see shortly this isn't strictly possible for a general -cosmos due to the fact that the natural composition of modules does not preserve the property of being discrete. In order to correct this we would need to require that our -cosmoi have suitable weak colimits. Instead of leaving their axiomatic construction at this point in order to obtain a pro-arrow equipment of modules, Riehl and Verity instead construct a weaker structure, known as a virtual equipment, as a full subcategory of a pro-arrow equipment of two-sided isofibrations.<br>Fibered Maps\nA fibered map of two-sided isofibrations from to is a fibered isomorphism class of strictly commuting diagrams\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/bea26a8ecac409c4d3992ef06bf44ffa.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nwhere two such diagrams with and are considered equivalent if there exists a natural isomorphism such that and .\nWe can view the -category of isofibrations from to in an -cosmos as a quotient of the homotopy -category . This -category exactly captures the notion of equivalence in in the sense that a pair of two-sided isofibrations are equivalent in if and only if they are isomorphic in this one-category.We can now define the double category which are virtual equipment will live insideDouble Category of Two-Sided Isofibrations\nThe homotopy -category of an -cosmos supports a (non-unital) double category of two-sided isofibrations whose: Objects are -categories\nvertical arrows are functors\nhorizontal arrows are two-sided isofibrations\nand whose squares with boundary and are maps of two-sided isofibrations over . This double category generally does not have a horizontal unit since the identity span is not generally a two-sided isofibration. However, when we restrict to the virtual double category of modules we will realize a unit from the arrow category. First let's recall the notion of a virtual double category, which can be thought of as an analogue of multicategories in the double categorical world.Virtual Double Category\nA virtual double category consists of A category of objects and vertical arrows\nFor any pair of objects and in a collection of horizontal arrows <br>Cells with boundary <img src=\"images/svg-cache/3918e27c764df2b06fd8328e1398a412.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nand composition given by pasting. an identity cell for vertical composition for every horizontal arrow . From our double category of two-sided isofibrations we can obtain a virtual double category with the same objects, vertical arrows, and -ary squares, as well as -ary cell of maps of two-sided isofibrations over given by<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/ab1b30e201282b6caf5870870b5057a1.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">whose vertical source is the -fold span composite of the sequence of spans [7, 8.1.11]. This construction gives us a unit, in the sense of virtual double categories, which is a -ary square with edges and horizontal two-sided isofibration .The virtual double category of modules can now be given as follows [7, 8.1.14]:Virtual Double Category of two-sided isofibrations\nThe virtual double category of modules is the full subcategory of the virtual double category of isofibrations whose objects are -categories\nvertical arrows are functors\nhorizontal arrows are modules from to -ary cells are fibered isomorphism classes of maps of two-sided isofibrations over , as above. Note the reason we needed to pass to virtual double categories is that , although being a two-sided isofibration, need not be a module (as it may fail to be discrete in ).In order to define a notion of Kan extension in it remains to show that this virtual double category has the structure of an virtual equipment.Virtual Equipment\nA virtual equipment is a virtual double category such that for any horizontal arrow and any pair of vertical arrows and , there exists a horizontal arrow and a unary cartesian cell satisfying the natural universal property\nevery object admits a unit horizontal arrow equipped with a nullary cocartesian cell satisfying the natural universal property (i.e. all -ary cells with object in their domain factor uniquely through and identities on the other components of the domain). <br>In , is exactly the arrow category as a module, while for and , we write for the base change given in <a data-href=\"An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules#^e47312\" href=\"board-talks/topology-seminar/an-introduction-to-formal-(infinity-)category-theory-via-modules.html#^e47312\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules &gt; ^e47312</a><a data-href=\"An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules#^e47312\" href=\"board-talks/topology-seminar/an-introduction-to-formal-(infinity-)category-theory-via-modules.html#^e47312\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">An Introduction to Formal (Infinity-)Category Theory via Modules &gt; ^e47312</a>.

The modules and define conjoints and companions for , respectively.We can now begin formalizing Kan extensions in . This can be done using the naive theory of right extensions in any bicategory, where the virtual bicategory we will be considering is . Since virtual bicategories take a slightly different form let's make this universal property explicit.A right extension of a module along a module consists of a module together with a binary cell<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/9e177c3fe8932f951e06d44833d8337c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which is universal in the sense that for -ary cell of the form below-left, we have a unique factorization into a composite below right:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/8032de0e98b901ce6fd580c1cd13c153.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">We can now finally define what it means for to have a pointwise right Kan extension in [7, 9.3.3]:<br>Pointwise Right Extension\nA diagram of the form\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/e053c632ef763b129f1592a9ed2d0d83.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nin is a pointwise right Kan extension if and only if defines a right extension in .\nIn order to get left Kan extensions we use the co-dual notion of right lifts in . The reason that these are pointwise is that the extensions defined in this way are stable under pasting with exact squares (or equivalently comma squares), which corresponds classically to the condition that the Kan extensions are stable under post-composition with representables.With the notion of pointwise right Kan extensions we can immediately start doing formal -category theory in . This will be expanded on in a future note for a future talk, but for now let's cite some interesting constructions and results we obtain with this theory.Facts:\nPointwise right extensions along right adjoints exist and are given by restriction along the left adjoint\nTaking a right extension along a fully faithful functor (as defined in a pro-arrow equipment with horizontal identities ) has as structure transformation an isomorphism\nA right adjoint is fully faithful if and only if its counit is an isomorphism\nLimits in agree with the following definition: A limit of a diagram of -categories is a pointwise right extension as below right<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/79864ae0812155f77072df5b2d3e8e6c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which agree with the classical definition in cartesian closed -cosmoi. More generally, given a module and a functor , we can say that a functor defines a -weighted limit of if it covariantly represents the right extension of along .

called a group\nKnow a few applications of mathematical braids to the sciences\nIn this lecture series we're going to explore how braids can be interpreted mathematically, and how these mathematical interpretations and abstractions help us solve other real world problems. We'll start today with getting on the same page with what we mean by braids, before seeing if we can turn our physical intuition into a precise mathematical statement.Using a dowel or wooden bar, tie strips of colourful ribbon or string to the dowel, at least 1 meter in length, and hang the dowel up.\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912211705.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912211705.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 200px; max-width: 100%;\">Fig 1. A visual of five coloured ribbons (red, pink, blue, cyan, and green, from left to right) hanging from a dowel, which is itself supported by a blue string attached to a pin.We can think of the ribbons as representing everyday things we braid with, such as our hair, thread and yarn in knitting and crocheting, ropes, wicker baskets, and even bread! Braids are also closely related to knots and tangles, which appear in art, jewelry, and architecture throughout cultures across the world. A braid then involves wrapping the ribbons around each other, and then fixing the ends of the ribbons once we've finished wrapping:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912215930.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912215930.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 200px; max-width: 100%;\">Fig 2. A visual of five coloured ribbons (red, pink, blue, cyan, and green, from left to right) hanging from a dowel, which is itself supported by a blue string attached to a pin, as in Figure 1. The ribbons are know wrapped over and under each other, with the red ribbon wrapping under the pink ribbon, and the blue and cyan ribbons wrapping under the green ribbon.The reason why we need to fix the bottoms of the ribbons after braiding them is that otherwise the ends could just slide back to the original hanging position, but these should be two different braids. This raises the important question, that is also foundational to a lot of mathematics, which is what would it mean for two braids to be equivalent?\nThey should involve the same number of ribbons\nWe should be able to bend ribbons as long as the ends are fixed, without changing the braid\nThis leads to our first informal, but mathematical, definition of a braid:Braids as Strings in 3D\nAn -braid for an integer is a collection of strings in -space, which are disjoint (i.e. they do not intersect), and monotone (in the direction). The th braid starts at the point and ends at the point , for some possibly different integer .\nTwo braids will be said to be equivalent if one can be deformed to the other without moving endpoints or intersecting strings.\nNote: The monotonicity requirement ensures that we can't knot a single ribbon with itself, which would not be a braid (but would be something called a tangle!).Exercise\nDetermine if the two Braids below are equivalent or not given what we've discussed so far:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912222003.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912222003.png\" target=\"_self\">\nFig 3.

Two dowels with five ribbons hanging off each of them, coloured red, pink, blue, cyan, and green, respectively. The ribbons on either dowel are braided together in a variety of ways.\nUsing the variable to indicate the direction our braids our going suggests another mathematical model for braids, which helps us get closer to a more precise mathematical definition.Braids as Time Histories or Particle Dances\nAn -braid for an integer is the time history of a collection of non-colliding particles in 2D space. More precisely, an -braid is a collection of continuous functions such that , and for all times if .\nThis definition motivates the visualization of walking along strings as they are built up into a braid.Ribbon Activity\nEach student gets a length of ribbon, with one end tapped to the ground under their feet. The students then walk in a path while unraveling the string or ribbon behind themselves before returning to one of the starting points, the whole time avoiding colliding with other students.\nQuestion What do the orientations of the crossings tell you about the particle paths?\nPulling your ribbon tight, see how the paths change, while giving you an equivalent, although visually very different, braid An important benefit of the particle dance perspective for braids is that it's easier to formalize what it means for two braids to be equivalent. Explicitly, we will say that an -braid is equivalent to an -braid if we have a family of continuous functionsso that , , and for all , is itself an -braid. The collection of functions can be thought of as a continuous family of braids. The first factor keeps track of the time evolution for the braids, while the second factor keeps track where we are in the family of braids. We can also think of the second factor as indicating how much we've deformed our initial braids so far.Now that we have some initial proposals for mathematical ways of formalizing braids, we can start investigating what types of properties and structures these braids have.Exercise\nOn a sheet of paper, or using strips of ribbon and tape, make a braid with 3 strings. Then at the bottom of the previous braid make another braid. We can view the result as a composite braid, though based on our formalism we have to be a bit careful, since our time should only go from to . To deal with the time issue, we can speed up the rate at which we trace the braids. In the particle model this means that for two braids and , their composite can be defined by taking the th trajectory to be The fact that we defined two braids to be equivalent if we can slide the strings to go from one presentation to another, while fixing endpoints, ensures that this definition doesn't depend on how we split up the interval . For example, we could trace the first braid in 1/3rd the time, and then the second braid in the remaining 2/3rds of the time:We could even take a brake in the middle before tracing the second braid\nOn Board: Draw out these examples, and/or use the ribbons.\nIn particular, the wiggling invariance ensures that we can put a collection of braids together two at a time, and the end result doesn't depend which pairs we put together first\nDraw on Board to clarify\nAdditionally, if we paste any braid with the braid of just straight ribbons, nothing happens. This tells us that braids can be given the structure of a group.Group\nA group consists of a collection of objects , thought of as symmetries of some underlying structure, together with a distinguished symmetry and a composition operation combining two symmetries.

Let's recall one of those definitions:Braids as Particle Dances\nA braid with strands, for an integer, is a collection of functions representing particles that don't collide, so that the following conditions hold: For each time , and distinct particles , For each particle , The collection of ending positions are the same as the collection of starting positions: Near the end of the first lesson we observed that if we have two braids with -strands, we can make a new braid by pasting them together<img src=\"images/svg-cache/f72f0f9ae69fecbde47c434e77af8378.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">we can make a new braid<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/a0d0be70ae860c66100e4d9a83b5fd98.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which can be equivalently drawn as<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/a587048dbc5049ac8c6d9690ebef0c22.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">In this lesson we're going to explore different properties related to this operation through a variety of activities and exercises.Exercise: Identities\nIs there a braid that when you compose it with any other braid it does nothing?\n<br>Exercise:\nConsider the braids below:\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/774a26b519c304d26d3299aa9aa606cf.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nFind braids that we can paste below these ones to undo them.\nTogether with associativity, these exercises show us that braids form what we call a group:Group\nA group consists of a collection of objects , thought of as symmetries of some underlying structure, together with a distinguished symmetry and a composition operation combining two symmetries. This data is subject to the following conditions: The distinguished symmetry is the do-nothing symmetry in the sense that for any other symmetry , .\nFor every symmetry in , an inverse symmetry such that .\nThe order in which a sequence of symmetries is combined two-at-a-time is independent of the resulting combined symmetry.

If no, explain your reasoning, if yes, give an example:\n<br>Hint:\nConsider the braids below:\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/56b3a0ad0373e0a9f5ef4896cf2717b3.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nDoes the order we put them together matter? Well if we do the left on top we get the braid on the left below, while if we do the right on top we get the braid on the right below:\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/21e6acb930c43b18542becc115dbd434.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nAs we've been seeing so far, we can make some very complicated braids. For example, we can do the same twist over and over to get the braid below:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/a23f2d8f9935be8704a3a75486bd6637.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">In particular, if we keep wrapping like this we can get infinitely many different braids, making the braid group pretty tricky to study. However, even though we have infinitely many possible braids, we can ask whether they are generated by some finite number of braids under the composition operation, and even better yet, if we can list finitely many relations between the generators. This leads to the notion of a presentation of a group.Presentation of a Group\nA presentation of a group is a collection of objects, such as , which generate , along with a collection of relations, such as , which determine how we can simplify expressions involving the generators.\nQuestion\nFor braids with -strands, what are some basic twists we have?\nThe braid group admits a presentation, which we refer to as the algebraic braid group . It has generators, , where is the braid crossing string over string , and the relations imposed areandThe first of these relations tells us that the order in which we cross strings is irrelevant as long as the two crossings don't involve the same strings:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/14b3c463c336bb02746f5b78160059e0.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">they just slide paste each other. The second relation is a bit less intuitive, but at least in the example below it tells us that if we cross the first strand over the second, and then over the third, which crosses under the first, this is the same as crossing the third strand under the second, and then under the first, which crosses over the third:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/680e8565179433d3496ae9baf0cecf0d.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">Exercise\nShow that the braid above satisfies and . Show that this implies commutes with all elements of .\n<br>Exercise\nDraw the braid with -strands :\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/d9c74f7c7f8192b9265cc3437d431554.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nWhat does this look like?\nQuestion\nCan we reduce the number of generators for ?\nHint: take any along with the partial twist . For example, using and we can get below:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/cb240b7493f3f1a68371d0e6e47976ca.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">A next step in studying a group involves breaking it up into smaller pieces. One such smaller piece for the braid group is what we call the pure braid group which only consists of those braids whose strands start and end at the same spot. For example, the full twist<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/d9c74f7c7f8192b9265cc3437d431554.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">is a pure braid, but the transposition<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/83b5d36fb4f862c45a0fb5001b3df3ba.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">is not. To recover information about the group from information about the pure braids, we also need to know about the braids we're missing. One way to isolate these braids is to pretend that the pure braids are trivial. This defines what we call the quotient group, , which is the same as the group of permutations on -letters . We can alternatively describe and in terms of configuration spaces, which give another way of formalizing braids, while also relating them to important applications in robotics.Configuration Space\nFor a space , its -th configuration space consists of those points in , which are ordered sequences of points in , , such that whenever (i.e. the points never overlap).\nThe pure braid group is then the fundamental group , while the full braid group is the fundamental group . Here the fundamental group, just like in our definition of particle dances, consists of paths in a space up to wiggling, but such that the paths must start and end at the same place. Additionally, the space consists of unordered sequences of points in , , such that whenever .\nThis allows us to have particles starting and ending at different positions\nApplication: Motion Planning\nConfiguration spaces are essential for planning the motion of large numbers of bodies moving about the same space so that they don't collide. Some examples are the following: Guided robots moving about a factory\nAir traffic control at a busy airport\nMotion planning on tracks Example\nWe can depict the configuration space for the letter as below:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250920004725.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250920004725.png\" target=\"_self\">\nExercise\nTry visualizing the configuration space for the letter . <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" target=\"_self\">Tutorial on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-1-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" target=\"_self\">Survey on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-2-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" target=\"_self\">RTG-Braids.pdf</a><a href=\"#fnref-3-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" target=\"_self\">singapore tutorial Ghrist.dvi</a> <a href=\"#fnref-4-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Learning Objectives","level":2,"id":"Learning_Objectives_0"},{"heading":"The Algebra of Mathematical Braids (c.f.1234)","level":2,"id":"The_Algebra_of_Mathematical_Braids_(c.f.[^1][^2][^3][^4])_0"},{"heading":"References","level":4,"id":"References_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"images/svg-cache/f72f0f9ae69fecbde47c434e77af8378.svg","fullURL":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-2-the-algebra-of-mathematical-braids.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["images/svg-cache/f72f0f9ae69fecbde47c434e77af8378.svg","images/svg-cache/a0d0be70ae860c66100e4d9a83b5fd98.svg","images/svg-cache/a587048dbc5049ac8c6d9690ebef0c22.svg","images/svg-cache/774a26b519c304d26d3299aa9aa606cf.svg","images/svg-cache/56b3a0ad0373e0a9f5ef4896cf2717b3.svg","images/svg-cache/21e6acb930c43b18542becc115dbd434.svg","images/svg-cache/a23f2d8f9935be8704a3a75486bd6637.svg","images/svg-cache/14b3c463c336bb02746f5b78160059e0.svg","images/svg-cache/680e8565179433d3496ae9baf0cecf0d.svg","images/svg-cache/d9c74f7c7f8192b9265cc3437d431554.svg","images/svg-cache/cb240b7493f3f1a68371d0e6e47976ca.svg","images/svg-cache/83b5d36fb4f862c45a0fb5001b3df3ba.svg","images/pasted-image-20250920004725.png"],"createdTime":1758325567653,"modifiedTime":1759092303011,"sourceSize":18031,"sourcePath":"Math Outreach Notes/Math Circle Notes/Braid Groups/Lesson 2 - The Algebra of Mathematical Braids.md","exportPath":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-2-the-algebra-of-mathematical-braids.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":16,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-3-recognizing-braids-using-algebra.html":{"title":"Lesson 3 - Recognizing Braids Using Algebra","icon":"","description":"\nAble to describe what the presentation of a group means in the example of braids\nAble to describe the word problem for groups\nAble to determine when two braids are different using their presentations\nOver the last two weeks we've learned how braids can be encoded mathematically using continuous functions, and we've seen that when we view them mathematically, braids exhibit the behaviour of something called a group. Recall that this means we can combine braids to make new braids<img src=\"images/svg-cache/a0d0be70ae860c66100e4d9a83b5fd98.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">and for any braid<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/b76a606aec4d92936416ba132743392a.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">we can find an inverse braid by flipping the braid and reversing its crossings:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/2087aea94f38187b40006ab88fa7a24d.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">The fact that these two braids are inverse means that when we combine them we get the basic braid with straight threads and no crossings.At the end of the last lesson we saw that there are an infinite number of braids, which can get extremely complicated, but luckily all braids can be built up by doing single crossings of neighboring strands:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/fd297ba8870cecc5dd8d92c8880bff25.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">In fact, we can describe the group of braids by using these neighbor crossings along with relations to tell us how we can put them together. This is related to the notion of presentations for groups which we mentioned last time:Presentation of a Group\nA presentation of a group is a collection of objects, such as , which generate , along with a collection of relations, such as , which determine how we can simplify expressions involving the generators.\nFor example, if is the braid group for three strands, then the generators are the neighbor twists, such as<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/9ea388166ead84eebcd2a1b9156d943a.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">while the only relation is that we have an equality<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/777ea4d96642054fb149ac13c7219133.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">Algebraically if represents the neighboring twist where the first strand goes over the second, and if represents the neighboring twist where the second strand goes over the third, then this relation saysIt turns out this completely determines how braids compose!! In general, if is the braid group on -strands, then it has generators , with relationswhich as above correspond to sliding our strands up or down, and relationswhich says that if we cross two strands, and then we cross two completely different strands, then the order we do this in doesn't matter. Visually this looks like we're just sliding up or down the crossings<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/bbda6c9e727ab31b1cef0cff3d8ee7b9.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\"><br>Exercise\nDraw the braid with -strands :\n<img src=\"images/svg-cache/d9c74f7c7f8192b9265cc3437d431554.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">\nWhat does this look like?\nOur goal today is to see if we can use this mathematical setup to determine when two braids are the same or different. For example, by the end of the lesson we should be able to say whether the braids<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/72b348eaf50cd8247ae32485619d0f8c.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">are the same or different in a systematic way. This is what's known as the word problem:The Word Problem\nIf is a group generated by some symmetries subject to a collection of relations, such as for example , how can I identify when two symmetries in are the same or different?\nSince braids form a group, we can always reduce the question of when two braids are equal by instead asking when some different, but related braid, can be pulled until we have no crossing strands.Question\nHow can we turn a problem about two braids being equal into a problem about whether a braid can be pulled straight or not? Given two braids, what would be the new braid that we want to pull straight?\nMathematically this comes from the fact that two symmetries and in a group are equal, , if and only if is the identity or do-nothing symmetry.Now we want to determine when a given braid is the same as the braid with no crossings, possibly after pulling the strands around. Since this means that the strands must all start and end at the same places, we can immediately reduce to those braids where all strands start and end at the same spot. We write for this collection of braids.Question\nIs still a group?\nAt this point in order to identity when braids are equivalent to the braid with no crossings, we proceed with a combing technique. The idea is that if we have a braid such as <br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/609a3cf0fd5fd2ed250e7cafbb4fa7a2.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">we start by combing out the last strand<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/cd51d2beec57b54816965acb182b3360.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">If this new braid can't be straightened out, then that means our original braid also can't be straightened out. To see whether this one can be straightened out we again comb out the last strand, which in this case gives the twist<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/df4fd50a8bea8e23cbc3fad487ad6e1f.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">which can't be straightened out. If we end up combing out and hitting a point when the braid can be pulled straight, then we go back to the previous, which will only involve the last strand crossing over and under the other strands, while all the other strands don't touch. For example, this could look something like this:<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/d3d1bb21295fa59890a7c90983fd3890.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">or more generally<br><img src=\"images/svg-cache/ced932cbadba990b3135c4a7e63aee4b.svg\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 2000px; max-width: 100%;\">Because of this we are reduced to determining when braids like this can be pulled until they have no crossings. Rhetorical Question\nHow can we determine when these kinds of braid can be straightened out?\nIf we think about the braid as represented by a particle dance, these braids can be considered as those particle dances where all but one of the particles remains stationary. Since the particles can't collide, we can represent this situation via a particle travelling on a disk with holes in it:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250926173536.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250926173536.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%;\">\nFig. A disk with a green, orange, and purple hole in it. A blue dot representing a particle lies on a blue curve that loops around the holes and represents the particle's motion.where now we don't have to we don't have to worry about crossings over. If we think about pulling the particle's history super tight, and bringing the wholes with it, this would be the same as if the particle lived on a little bouquet of circles:<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20250926174116.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250926174116.png\" target=\"_self\">\nFig. Three circles attached at a single point, with a red dot representing a particle lying in their center.The particle doing loops in this tree can then be realized visually as if it was walking along a fractal tree. If we only had two other strands originally, so that we only have two circles in the bouquet, this would look like the graph<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250926174740.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250926174740.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%;\">\nFig. A fractal pattern with vertical and horizontal lines representing different ways to loop around two attached circles.so that the only way to go back to the origin of the graph, which represents the particle sitting still, is to retrace our steps.A similar problem which uses the same kind of technique as the last two steps is the following:Question\nIf I have a braid, call it , is it possible to paste it end to end and eventually get the trivial braid?\nThis question may have an intuitive visual answer, but showing it precisely can be quite difficult. The idea behind how we can show it is a new representation of braids, which is similar to the disk picture we previously had. Explicitly, we can think of a braid as something that takes in a disk made of putty with evenly spaced holes, like in the picture<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250926175538.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250926175538.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%;\">\nFig. A disk with a green, orange, and purple hole in the center, along with horizontal lines attaching the holes.and then pushes around the holes in the putty without every breaking them to get a new configuration:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250926180247.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250926180247.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 400px; max-width: 100%;\">\nFig. A disk with a green, orange, and purple hole in the center, where the holes have now been rearranged while keeping the lines attached.In these reconfigurations we've kept track of the centerline and how it moves. We can use this perspective to say when one braid is smaller than another. We do this by using the fact that the center line and its new position splits the disk into two pieces, and so one braid is smaller if part of it lies in the lower piece of another braid after pulling everything tight.We won't focus on this in the lesson, but it can be shown that if we have two braids and with , then for any other braid , . In particular, if is a braid that can't be straightened, then either the braid with no crossings, or , and in either case if I keep pasting onto itself I'll get something that is either smaller than, or greater than, . <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" target=\"_self\">Tutorial on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-1-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" target=\"_self\">Survey on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-2-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" target=\"_self\">RTG-Braids.pdf</a><a href=\"#fnref-3-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" target=\"_self\">singapore tutorial Ghrist.dvi</a> <a href=\"#fnref-4-16a94bd5e175a172\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Learning Objectives","level":2,"id":"Learning_Objectives_0"},{"heading":"Recognizing Braids Using Algebra (c.f.1234)","level":2,"id":"Recognizing_Braids_Using_Algebra_(c.f.[^1][^2][^3][^4])_0"},{"heading":"Step 1: Recognizing braids by recognizing trivial braids","level":3,"id":"Step_1_Recognizing_braids_by_recognizing_trivial_braids_0"},{"heading":"Step 2: Reducing to braids where strands start and end at the same spots","level":3,"id":"Step_2_Reducing_to_braids_where_strands_start_and_end_at_the_same_spots_0"},{"heading":"Step 3: Combing Braids in <span class=\"math math-inline is-loaded\"><mjx-container class=\"MathJax\" jax=\"CHTML\"><mjx-math class=\"MJX-TEX\"><mjx-msub><mjx-mi class=\"mjx-i\"><mjx-c class=\"mjx-c1D443 TEX-I\"></mjx-c></mjx-mi><mjx-script style=\"vertical-align: -0.15em;

(write this out on the board) Give them some other examples they might know (i.e. integers and addition, rotations of triangles, rotations of the circle, ...) Lecture 2: Recall main points from previous lecture In particular, recall braid composition, and how it forms a group Ask the question of whether we can get all braids by some finite number of braids\nGive the third description of the braid group using generators and relations Maybe do exercise 1.5 or 1.6 in1?\nDo Exercise 1.11 Maybe talk about Pure braids and permutations, and how arises (in informal language)\nThen recall the particle perspective about braids, and talk about how and can be formalized in terms of configuration spaces Remark about connections to robotics\nTry vizualizing the configuration space for the letter . Remark about deforming configuration spaces without changing braid groups Lecture 3: Word problems!!! Recall braids as a group and the definition of a group\nMention the Word Problem for a group with a presentation, and how it is in general unsolvable\nBreakdown the solution to the word problem in into bite-size steps\nIf there is time prove that the braid groups are torsion free2 Mention how visually this might be intuitive, but it is quite hard to make mathematically precise Regard as (mapping class group of disk with -punctures), where we choose the punctures to be spaced evenly along the interval on the -axis. The image of under a homeomorphism fixing the boundary splits the disk into two halves. If and are two such homeomorphism, we can then define if for (the being the punctures), and an initial segment of lies in the upper component of the disk when halved by This defines a left-invariant ordering, from which we can show has no torsion elements.
