Note that . This notation is used since we have an isomorphism . Recall that is the limit sketch whose objects are morphisms in (i.e. morphisms in ), and whose morphisms are commuting triangles. Note that this is precisely the opposite of the full subcategory , which under our previous isomorphism corresponds to profunctors such that is the singleton for all and .

Let be the walking tight arrow, let be the walking tight composite, and let be the double category with two non-identity tight arrows and , and one non-identity loose arrow , with no non-identity cells. Using the barrel perspective on loose bimodules we then define bimodules , , and as inandTogether these loose bimodules can be represented by the diagramNow, towards a contradiction suppose we had a pseudo-associative notion of composition satisfying , Firstly, we define the VDC to be the sub-VDC of whose loose arrows consist of two-sided codiscrete cofibrations:VDC's internal to If we can make sense of VDCs internal to another category, is a virtual double 2-category?\nQuestion\nIs a pro-representable VDC?\nQuestion\nIs there a Grothendieck type construction for VD functors into ?\nIn addition to restriction of loose bimodules we can also consider collapse of loose bimodules. This is most easily defined in the context of two-sided double fibrations , where we simply post-compose by the unique map into the terminal double category. This construction defines loose bimodule , and in fact we get a cartesian 2-functorIn particular, we get induced 2-functorsWe also have the cartesian pseudo-functor , and hence the pseudo-functorsandWe then get a natural cartesian 2-functor such that the composite lands in , the full sub--category of symmetric monoidal loose right modules.

In the language of two-sided double fibrations these two pseudo-functors on symmetric monoidal loose bimodules correspond to andIn particular, we see that we get a natural comparison map\nClaim: This extends into a pseudo-natural transformation .\nRecall that given a two-sided double fibration , the associated loose bimodule has for and those loose arrows which are objects of lying over and on the left and right. Thus, is given by the following data:\nThe terminal double category lying over and the double category lying over For each , and each pro-arrow in over the walking loose arrow, a pro-arrow , and for each cell in over the walking loose arrow below left, a cell in below right Composition on the left is strictly unital, while composition on the right is given as in using the description of loose arrows and cells as above.\nVertical composition of cells over the walking loose arrow is given as below:\nusing the vertical composition in .Example 10 (-categorical Example).\nLet be a symmetric monoidal -category, so that we have the natural symmetric monoidal hom-two sided (discrete) fibration , which corresponds to the (discrete) bimodule , or the profunctor . The collapse corresponds to the (not necessarily discrete) two-sided fibration , or the profunctor , or the bimodule .\nWe now discuss a bimodule-oriented notion of loose adjunction.Definition 11 (Loose Adjunction).\nGiven virtual double functors , a lax loose adjunction between them consists of an adjunction of loose bimodules . <br>Libkind, S., Jaz Meyers, D., Carlson, K.
