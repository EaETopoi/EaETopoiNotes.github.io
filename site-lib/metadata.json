Primarily this note follows the structure and exposition in section I.2 of Bastiaan Cnossen's thesis<a data-footref=\"1\" href=\"#fn-1-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[1]</a> and the preliminaries section to Cnossen et al.'s paper on parameterized higher semiadditivity<a data-footref=\"2\" href=\"#fn-2-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>.

Another motivation for this approach comes from the observation that a continuous map of spaces induces a geometric morphism of -topoi. In this way, such a morphism allows us to consider as a -category which carries the information of the original sheaf topos on along with topological properties of the continuous map inducing it.Throughout will be an -topos, which is to say a left exact and accessible localization of a presheaf -category for some small -category , where is the -category of -groupoids.There are three main presentations of -categories internal to the -topos :\nThe simplicial perspective\nThe sheaf perspective\nThe fibered perspective\nWe write for the -spine, which can be viewed as a simplicial -groupoid , and we write for the walking equivalence. We will often use the algebraic morphism in the adjunction to identify simplicial -groupoids, such as these, with simplicial objects in .-category (Simplicial Definition)\nA -category is a simplicial object that is internally local with respect to (Segal conditions) and (univalence). We write for the full subcategory spanned by -categories. A -groupoid is a simplicial object which is internally local with respect to . We write for the full subcategory spanned by -groupoids.\nThe -groupoids are precisely the essential image of the diagonal embedding so that . The statement that is internally local with respect to a certain morphism in means that the canonical map is internally right orthogonal to the morphisms, or equivalently that the induced mapis an equivalence. The inclusion preserves filtered colimits and admits a left adjoint preserving finite products. In particular, is presentable and an exponential ideal in , so in particular is cartesian closed. We can define bifunctors\n(Functor -category) (Powering) (Tensoring) which fit into 2-variable adjunctions In particular, evaluating the left equivalence at the terminal -category we have , so that gives rise to a -enrichment of , or in other words an -categorical enhancement.\nUsing our previously defined bifunctor, we have a natural fully-faithful embedding which factors through an equivalenceThus, -categories are equivalent to sheaves of -categories . When is a copre-sheaf -topos, we have a natural equivalenceThus, the current perspective generalizes the notion of paramaterized -categories. Additionally, via the un/straightening correspondence we obtain an embedding .For a -category and , we write for the -category of local sections over , and write for the restriction along a map in . One can also interpret as the complete Segal space whose space of -morphisms is given by the -groupoid .For a geometric morphism with left adjoint , is given by restriction along , while is given by left Kan extension along . If admits a further left adjoint , then this is just precomposition with .Explication: Objects and Morphisms in -Categories\nUsing the two-variable adjunctions introduced previously, one obtains equivalences for all , , and (with the diagonal embedding left implicit). Combining this with a previous remark we see that Let's see some examples in the sheaf perspective:-groupoid\nEvery object of defines a -category via the Yoneda embedding The -categories of this form are called -groupoids.\nThe -category of -groupoids\nSince is a topos, the functor associated to the cartesian fibration (i.e. ) preserves limits and thus defines a -category denoted by , and refer to it as the -category of -groupoids.\nLet's now move to describing internal (co)limits in the parameterized setting.-colimits\nLet be an -category and let be a class of morphisms in closed under base change (i.e. base-changes of morphisms in exist and have output again in ). Given a functor , we say that admits -colimits or is -cocomplete if the following conditions are satisfied: (1) For every in , the functor admits a left adjoint (2) For every pullback square in with , the Beck-Chevalley transformation of functors is an equivalence.\nExplication\nIf is terminal, then the functor having a left adjoint is analogous to the diagonal having a left adjoint, which occurs precisely when has -shaped colimits. In general we can think of as a kind of left Kan extension. The Beck-Chevalley transformation then says that left Kan extensions formed in this way are preserved under base-change.\nDually, if has a right adjoint such that the corresponding Beck-Chevalley transformations are equivalences, then we say admits -limits.Often we will add the assumption that is an -topos, and that the class in is local in the sense that a morphism is in whenever there exists an effective epimorphism in such that each of the base change maps is in .Preserving -colimits\nLet be -cocomplete. A natural transformation is said to preserve -colimits if for every morphism in the Beck-Chevalley map is an equivalence (we also say is -cocontinuous).\nExample: Base Case\nWhen , global sections defines an equivalence , with inverse given by sending to . For , a cat then has -colimits if and only if we can perform left Kan extension for space-indexed functors into along morphisms in .\nIn addition to groupoid indexed colimits defined in this fashion, we will also be interested in fiberwise colimits:Fiberwise Colimits\nLet be a (non-parameterized) -category. We say that a -category has fiberwise -shaped colimits if the category has -shaped colimits for every and the restriction functor preserves -shaped colimits for each in .\nWe say a functor of -categories with fiberwise -shaped colimits preserves fiberwise -shaped colimits if it preserves -shaped colimits pointwise.<br>Combining these notions we will say a -category is cocomplete if it is -cocomplete in the parameterized sense and moeover fiberwise cocomplete. Analogously to the classical theory, if is a cocomplete -category, then the inclusion of constant diagrams has a left adjoint for every and every small -category (c.f. Corollary 5.4.7 of<a data-footref=\"4\" href=\"#fn-4-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4-1]</a>).Definition: Symmetric Monoidal -category\nA symmetric monoidal -category is a commutative monoid in the -category , or equivalently, a limit-preserving functor .\nFor we denote the tensor product and monoidal unit of by and , respectively.Definition: Presentable -Categories\nA -category is called fiberwise presentable if it factors (necessarily uniquely) through the subcategory of presentable -categories and colimit preserving functors. We say is presentable if it is fiberwise presentable and additionally satisfies the following two conditions: (1) (Left Adjoints) For all in , the restriction has left adjoint (2) (Left Base Change) For every , with pullback cospan , the Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence. If are presentable -categories, we say -functor preserves (parameterized) colimits if the following two properties are satisfied:\n(1) For every , the functor preserves small colimits;\n(2) For every in , the Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence\nNote that in the left Base change condition, passing to right adjoints gives that the other Beck-Chevalley transformation is also an equivalence by uniqueness of adjoints and the fact that and . In fact, for a commuting diagramwith the morphisms fitting into adjoint triples , etc., the Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence if and only if the Beck-Chevalley transformationis an equivalence, since and .-Parameterized Animae\nThe target functor is a cartesian fibration, so by (HTT, Theorem 6.1.3.9) is classified by a limit-preserving functor The pullback functors have left adjoints which satisfy the Beck-Chevalley condition, so is a presentable -category, called the -category of -groupoids.\n<br>As with un-parameterized presentable -categories, presentable -categories have a natural tensor product, characterized by the fact that it represents bi-cocontinuous -functors (c.f.<a data-footref=\"6\" href=\"#fn-6-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[6-1]</a>, Section 8.2). This gives the structure of a symmetric monoidal -category whose monoidal unit is . In particular, the classical formula carries over to giveThe universal property satisfied by this parameterized monoidal structure can be expressed by the equivalencewhich in particular implies that preserves colimits.Presentably Symmetric Monoidal -Category\nA presentably symmetric monoidal -category is a commutative algebra object in the symmetric monoidal -category .\nNote that we have an embedding so that a symmetric monoidal -category is presentably symmetric monoidal if and only if it is presentable, and the tensor product -functor is bi-cocontinuous. This can be expressed by the following two non-parameterized conditions:\n(Fiberwise presentably symmetric monoidal) For each , the tensor product functor is bi-cocontinuous\n(Left Projection Formula) For each in and all objects and , the exchange morphism is an equivalence\nEquivalently, this can be expressed as a limit-preserving functor such that the symmetric monoidal restriction functors admit left adjoints that satisfy base change and satisfy the left projection formula.To continue the preliminaries needed for twisted ambidexterity, the next step is to understand the algebra and module theory associated to the symmetric monoidal -category . Before diving into this material we will review some basic aspects of the theory of -operads, and the theory algebras over algebraic patterns more generally. <br>Bastiaan Cnossen. “Twisted Ambidexterity in Equivariant Homotopy Theory: Two Approaches.” Phd, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, 2024. <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11811/11281\" target=\"_self\">https://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11811/11281</a>.<a href=\"#fnref-1-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Cnossen, Bastiaan, Tobias Lenz, and Sil Linskens. “Parametrized (Higher) Semiadditivity and the Universality of Spans.” arXiv:2403.07676.

What does this mean?\nIf is a monoidal -category and is an -category enriched in , we write for the -mapping object of . When is closed, we write for . For every -category we write . The importance of -finite maps and spaces lies in their use as indexing -categories for diagrams that we are interested in comparing limits and colimits of. Specifically, the in -semiadditivity indicates the size of the -finite spaces for which we have norm mapswhich are equivalences. Let's begin with the basic notion of ambidexterity in chromatic homotopy theory.Ambidexterity of -finite Maps\nLet . A -finite map is called: weakly -ambidextrous if it is an equivalence, or is -ambidextrous\n-ambidextrous if it is weakly -ambidextrous, admits all -limits and -colimits, and the norm map is an equivalence. A -finite map, i.e. an equivalence, is always -ambidextrous. If is -finite, then the diagonalis -finite and the ambidexterity of allows in turn the definition of .The property of being -ambidextrous is preserved by pullbacks and determined by its fibers. Since the fibers of the diagonal are path spaces of , is weakly -ambidextrous if and only if the path spaces of are -ambidextrous. This begins the inductive construction since the path-space reduces from an -finite space to an -finite space.Prop: Characterization of -Ambidextrous Morphism\nLet be an -category and let be a -finite map. The map is -ambidextrous if and only if the following hold: is weakly -ambidextrous admits all -limits and -colimits\nEither preserves all -colimits or preserves all -limits. Proof Idea.\nFrom the discussion above, we can assume wlog that . The forward implication is immediate due to the norm equivalence, so it suffices to show that if (1)-(3) hold, then the norm map is an equivalence. ***Prop: Closure of Ambidexterity under -category constructions\nLet be an -category and let be a -finite -ambidextrous space. The space is also -ambidextrous for (1) (2) for an -category\n(3) containing the final object and closed under -limits for all and (4) containing the initial object and closed under -colimits for all and . Note: Here is the -fold based loop space at .The first two properties are classical, while the last two are dual and follow from the inductive construction of norm maps.Important\nThe main feature of ambidexterity is that it allows us to integrate families of morphisms in . That is, given a -ambidextrous map and , we have a map which can be given by the composite When we can think of an element of as a map , and as the sum of over points of . Explicitly, the identification of mapping spaces comes from the equivalences Intuition for Induction: For a space and a diagram , to specify a norm map is to specify a homotopy coherently compatible collection of morphisms , for . always provides a family of candidates for these maps, , but a-priori there is no coherent choice for them which can be made. But, if we can integrate over the spaces , we can just takeWhen is constant on some object , then the Norm map is the same as a map of spaces , where the above construction specializes to .Important\nThe initial claim comes from the natural equivalences where is the whiskering of , while is the whiskering of . Thus, we have a natural equivalence Thus, the data of a map is equivalent to the data of a map of simplicial sets such that and .\nFurther, in the case when is the constant functor at some . In this case, the data of a map is equivalent to the data of a map of simplicial sets such that . A natural family of such transformations is then a map of simplicial sets such that .\nMore generally, if has all -shaped (co)limits, so that we have functors , then the natural equivalences we want are given by using adjoints and (co)continuity of the diagonal:Thus, a family of norms is equivalent to a natural transformation .Similarly, if has all -shaped (co)limits for , so that exist, then we have natural maps<br>where is the natural equivalence coming from , and the center map uses the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories\" data-href=\"Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/calculus-of-mates-for-infinity-categories.html\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">mate calculus</a><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories\" data-href=\"Calculus of Mates for Infinity Categories\" href=\"reading-notes/homotopy-theory/higher-algebra/calculus-of-mates-for-infinity-categories.html\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">mate calculus</a> on this transformation to obtain . If this Beck-Chevalley transformation is an equivalence, then it follows that the data of a norm is equivalent to the data of a natural transformation . Since the square in which appears is a homotopy pullback square of -groupoids, and hence we can assume without loss of generality that is a Kan fibration, the square is exact, and hence it satisfies the Beck-Chevalley condition (c.f. Chapter 13 of<a data-footref=\"4\" href=\"#fn-4-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[4]</a>).Inductive Approach: If is an -finite space, then the path spaces are -finite. Thus, if inductively we have invertible canonical norm maps for all -finite spaces , then we obtain a canonical way to integrate -finite families of morphisms, which allows us to define norm maps for all -finite spaces. Whether all these new norm maps are isomorphisms is now a property, which if holding let's us continue the induction:\n() We define every -category to be -semiadditive. Recall that the -finite spaces are the contractible ones, and the canonical norm map is hence an equivalence, being equivalent to the identity transformation on . This just says we can canonically sum a one point family of maps.\n() The only non-contractible -finite space is . The associated norm map is the unique map from the initial object to the terminal object of , which always exists. Thus, is -semiadditive if and only if it is pointed. This allows integration of empty families of morphisms, which is to say that for any , we get a canonical zero map given by the composition () Let be an -finite space, and suppose is -semiadditive. Then in particular we have an equivalence , which corresponds to a wrong-way co-unit and a wrong-way unit , so that we can define the map which from the discussion preceding the induction is equivalent to a norm map , which is given by where the Beck-Chevalley transformation can be written as the composite As a first example, in the step is equivalent to a set, so we can replace by a set if necessary. Then is precisely a set of objects in indexed by those in , and is the matrix of objects with and when , and similarly is the matrix of objects with and with . On the other hand, and are matrices with constant rows and constant columns, respectively. The compositeis given precisely by the matrix of maps with , while for , is the unique composite through the zero object. The norm map is then the compositeAs a second example, if we're doing the step with a connected -finite space, so that for some finite group , then . Write for the unique map to the point. Further, and for are the homotopy orbits and fixed points, respectively, while for is an object with trivial action, is given -action with trivial right action component, and similarly for . Finally, if is a - object, then is the -space given by taking homotopy orbits with respect to the first factor, and is the -space given by taking homotopy fixed points with respect to the first factor. Now, the compositeis given by summing over orbits. Finally, the first map is given by sending the orbits of a -space to the homotopy fixed points of the homotopy orbits with trivial action, and the last map is given by sending the the homotopy fixed points of the homotopy orbits of the original -object viewed itself as a -object with trivial action, to the homotopy fixed points of the underlying object. Thus, the resulting norm map is precisely the classical orbit map:given informally by .Integrating the identity morphism yields the notion of -cardinality.-cardinality\nLet and let be a -ambidextrous map. We have a natural transformation given by the composition For a -ambidextrous space , we write and call the -cardinality of .\nNote that for a given object , is exactly .Motivating Example\nLet be a semiadditive -category. For a finite set , viewed as an -finite space, the operation is simply the multiplication by the natural number which is the usual cardinality of .\nNote: For a -ambidextrous space , the -limits and -colimits in are canonically isomorphic, which implies the following:Prop: Preservation of Limits and Colimits for Ambidextrous Spaces\nLet , and let be a - and -ambidextrous space.

Note that if is a full subcategory of an -semiadditive -category, then if is either stable under -finite colimits or -finite limits, then it is stable under both, and it is -semiadditive itself.-Commutative Monoids\nLet . For , the -category of -commutative monoids in is given by When we write , and refer to its objects as -commutative monoids.\nIn the case , evaluating at , the unique object of , gives an equivalence .Explication ()\nAn object consists of an underlying space , together with a collection of coherent operations for summation of -finite families of points in it. Indeed, for , we have a canonical equivalence .

The restriction along the inclusion functor induces a limit preserving functor Proof.\nIt suffices to prove that preserves -finite colimits. By the description of colimits in spans it suffices to prove that is stable under -finite colimits.\nQuestion\nHow can we see that has -finite colimits? If is an -finite diagram, then How do we know that is also -finite? We know that is -finite and that all fibers of the Kan fibration are -finite, so it is also an -finite map. Do -finite maps compose?\nThe following answers the above question:Prop: -finite Maps Compose\nIf and are -finite, then so is their composite .\nProof.\nTaking fibers, it suffices to show that if is an -finite map with an -finite space, then is also -finite. For each point , we have a homotopy fiber sequence where is also -finite, by definition of -finite maps. Thus, looking at the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for each , we see that is also -truncated, has finitely many path components, and has all homotopy groups begin finite, completing the proof.\nWe extend to by defining for the -categorywith limit computed in . This is equivalent toConsequently, when is presentable, is presentable for all , and can then be described as a colimit of in :Lemma: as Colimit in For , the forgetful functors admit left adjoints, and the colimit of the sequence in is . In particular, is presentable.\nThe mapping spaces between two objects in an -semiadditive -category have a canonical -commutative monoid structure.Prop: Universality of Let .

We have the following universal example of an -semiadditive -category:Universal Case\nFor the symmetric monoidal -category of spans is the universal -semiadditive -category. For every , we have Note that is the set of isomorphism classes of -finite spaces with semiring structure given by Similarly, is the universal presentable -semiadditive -category. The Yoneda embedding induces a fully-faithful -semiadditive symmetric monoidal functor taking an -finite space to the free -commutative monoid on .\nHomotopy Cardinality\nFor a -finite space , the homotopy cardinality of is the rational number We say an -category is semirational if it is -semiadditive (i.e. -finite spaces are -ambidextrous, which are contractible, empty, and discrete spaces) and for each , multiplication by is invertible in (e.g. or ). Here multiplication by on an object is given by the cardinality , which is the composite A semirational -category which admits all -finite colimits is automatically -semiadditive, and for every -finite space , we have that its cardinality is its homotopy cardinality: This comes from the fact that the cardinality is additive, and for every fiber sequence of -finite spaces where is connected, . In Chromatic homotopy theory we often come across examples of -semiadditive -categories of higher height. For a given prime , and , let be the Morava -theory spectrum of height at the prime . We have that the localizations and are -semiadditive. For , , and the cardinalities recover the homotopy cardinality. Similarly, since is -local for all , if is a -finite space whose homotopy groups have cardinality prime to , then the -local cardinality of coincides with the homotopy cardinality for all by the previous example. However, this does not hold in general for -finite spaces whose cardinality is not prime to .To study the -local cardinalities of -finite spaces, it is useful to consider their image in Morava -theory. For , let be the Morava -theory associated with some formal group of height over , viewed as an object of . In particular, we have a (non-canonical) isomorphismChromatic Cardinality\nThe -category is -semiadditive by Theorem 5.3.1 in6, and hence we can consider cardinalities of -finite spaces in . The -typical height cardinality of a -finite space is defined to be For we can identify with , and so can recover the homotopy cardinality. For , let be the -adic free loop space of . It turns out that belongs to the subring and satisfies . Applying this inductively we see that for the -typical height cardinality in terms of the homotopy cardinality. If is a -space, then coincides with the ordinary loop space.\nQuestion\nHow can we show that when is a -space? Hint: First consider the universal examples . The following gives another family of examples of higher semiadditive -categories:Prop: is -semiadditive\nFor every the -category is -semiadditive.\nCategorical Cardinality\nLet and let . For every -finite space , the -semiadditive structure of gives rise to a functor . When , is given by taking the constant colimit on . Since preserves limits, and hence is -semiadditive, the same claim holds for .\nConversely, the -semiadditive structure on is given by taking limits of constant diagrams.(co)Cartesian -commutative Monoid Structure\nFor , since is freely generated from a point under -finite colimits, we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cocartesian structure. Dually, for , we have and the resulting -commutative monoid structure on is referred to as the cartesian structure.\nThe full subcategory is closed under colimits, and in particular is -semiadditive, since the inclusion admits the right adjoint .Recall that for a symmetric monoidal -category with subcategory spanned by dualizable objects, every admits a trace or Euler characteristic given by the compositewhere the symmetrizer in the center can be thought of as the analogue of our norm map in this context. For example, if , and , then is the Euler characteristic of the finite space (here finite is in the sense of -compactness, which is equivalent to being weakly equivalent to a finite CW complex).On the other hand, in the context of -ambidexterity for a -finite map and a (co)complete -category (or at least finitely complete with sufficient limits and colimits so the following adjunctions exist), we look at the adjunctions where is pullback, is left Kan extension along , and is right Kan extension along . When is the point, becomes the diagonal, , and . The Norm map is then a natural comparison map (which need not always exist)which in the case of -ambidexterity of is an equivalence, along with all the associated norm maps for diagonal of .

Then is the category of -valued -representations for a commutative ring . The map is given by sending an -module to the trivial representation associated to it. On the other hand, sends a -representation to the -module of -orbits, and sends a -representation to the -module of -fixed points. We then have a natural norm mapThe kernel of this map consists of those -orbits such that , while the image always at least contains . The norm map fits in the Tate cohomology groups which are defined byRecall here that , and that are the right derived functors of the fixed point functor, while , and are the left derived functors. We can also describe the group cohomology as the cohomology of the cochain complex associated to the simplicial -module , with face operators given by multiplying arguments internally, or acting on the left/right (with right action being trivial), and degeneracies given by inserting identities.Example\nConsider the case of and . Then is just multiplication by , implying that but .\nExample\nIf is a commutative ring and is a group with , then is multiplication by , and hence is an isomorphism. In particular, the norm map for any constant representation is an isomorphism.\nExample\nIf , , and with the action given by the inclusion , then is the space of homotopy orbits, while is the space of homotopy fixed points, so we would never have the norm map being an isomorphism.\nLet be a finite group and let be the unique -finite map of spaces.

Equivalently, and , where here we're using that is tensored and cotensored over , being complete and cocomplete. Explicitly, for a spectrum , is the -equivariant mapping spectrum and with diagonal action. In this situation the Tate construction measures the defect for being -ambidextrous:Here for a -module, the Tate construction has homotopy groups recovering the Tate cohomology <br>Carmeli, S., Schlank, T.M., Yanovski, L.: Ambidexterity and Height, <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13089\" target=\"_self\">http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13089</a>, (2020)<a href=\"#fnref-1-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br>Cnossen, Bastiaan, Tobias Lenz, and Sil Linskens. “Parametrized (Higher) Semiadditivity and the Universality of Spans.” arXiv:2403.07676.

We'll start today with getting on the same page with what we mean by braids, before seeing if we can turn our physical intuition into a precise mathematical statement.Using a dowel or wooden bar, tie strips of colourful ribbon or string to the dowel, at least 1 meter in length, and hang the dowel up.\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912211705.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912211705.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 200px; max-width: 100%;\">Fig 1. A visual of five coloured ribbons (red, pink, blue, cyan, and green, from left to right) hanging from a dowel, which is itself supported by a blue string attached to a pin.We can think of the ribbons as representing everyday things we braid with, such as our hair, thread and yarn in knitting and crocheting, ropes, wicker baskets, and even bread! Braids are also closely related to knots and tangles, which appear in art, jewelry, and architecture throughout cultures across the world. A braid then involves wrapping the ribbons around each other, and then fixing the ends of the ribbons once we've finished wrapping:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912215930.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912215930.png\" target=\"_self\" style=\"width: 200px; max-width: 100%;\">Fig 2. A visual of five coloured ribbons (red, pink, blue, cyan, and green, from left to right) hanging from a dowel, which is itself supported by a blue string attached to a pin, as in Figure 1. The ribbons are know wrapped over and under each other, with the red ribbon wrapping under the pink ribbon, and the blue and cyan ribbons wrapping under the green ribbon.The reason why we need to fix the bottoms of the ribbons after braiding them is that otherwise the ends could just slide back to the original hanging position, but these should be two different braids. This raises the important question, that is also foundational to a lot of mathematics, which is what would it mean for two braids to be equivalent?\nThey should involve the same number of ribbons\nWe should be able to bend ribbons as long as the ends are fixed, without changing the braid\nThis leads to our first informal, but mathematical, definition of a braid:Braids as Strings in 3D\nAn -braid for an integer is a collection of strings in -space, which are disjoint (i.e. they do not intersect), and monotone (in the direction). The th braid starts at the point and ends at the point , for some possibly different integer .\nTwo braids will be said to be equivalent if one can be deformed to the other without moving endpoints or intersecting strings.\nNote: The monotonicity requirement ensures that we can't knot a single ribbon with itself, which would not be a braid (but would be something called a tangle!).Exercise\nDetermine if the two Braids below are equivalent or not given what we've discussed so far:<br>\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912222003.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912222003.png\" target=\"_self\">\nFig 3. Two dowels with five ribbons hanging off each of them, coloured red, pink, blue, cyan, and green, respectively. The ribbons on either dowel are braided together in a variety of ways.\nWhat about the two braids\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20250912222605.png\" src=\"images/pasted-image-20250912222605.png\" target=\"_self\">\nFig 4. Two dowels with five ribbons hanging off each of them, coloured red, pink, blue, cyan, and green, respectively. The ribbons on either dowel are braided together in a variety of ways.\nUsing the variable to indicate the direction our braids our going suggests another mathematical model for braids, which helps us get closer to a more precise mathematical definition.Braids as Time Histories or Particle Dances\nAn -braid for an integer is the time history of a collection of non-colliding particles in 2D space. More precisely, an -braid is a collection of continuous functions such that , and for all times if .\nThis definition motivates the visualization of walking along strings as they are built up into a braid.Ribbon Activity\nEach student gets a length of ribbon, with one end tapped to the ground under their feet. The students then walk in a path while unraveling the string or ribbon behind themselves before returning to one of the starting points, the whole time avoiding colliding with other students.\nQuestion What do the orientations of the crossings tell you about the particle paths?\nPulling your ribbon tight, see how the paths change, while giving you an equivalent, although visually very different, braid An important benefit of the particle dance perspective for braids is that it's easier to formalize what it means for two braids to be equivalent. Explicitly, we will say that an -braid is equivalent to an -braid if we have a family of continuous functionsso that , , and for all , is itself an -braid. The collection of functions can be thought of as a continuous family of braids. The first factor keeps track of the time evolution for the braids, while the second factor keeps track where we are in the family of braids. We can also think of the second factor as indicating how much we've deformed our initial braids so far.Now that we have some initial proposals for mathematical ways of formalizing braids, we can start investigating what types of properties and structures these braids have.Exercise\nOn a sheet of paper, or using strips of ribbon and tape, make a braid with 3 strings. Then at the bottom of the previous braid make another braid. We can view the result as a composite braid, though based on our formalism we have to be a bit careful, since our time should only go from to . To deal with the time issue, we can speed up the rate at which we trace the braids. In the particle model this means that for two braids and , their composite can be defined by taking the th trajectory to be The fact that we defined two braids to be equivalent if we can slide the strings to go from one presentation to another, while fixing endpoints, ensures that this definition doesn't depend on how we split up the interval . For example, we could trace the first braid in 1/3rd the time, and then the second braid in the remaining 2/3rds of the time:We could even take a brake in the middle before tracing the second braid\nOn Board: Draw out these examples, and/or use the ribbons.\nIn particular, the wiggling invariance ensures that we can put a collection of braids together two at a time, and the end result doesn't depend which pairs we put together first\nDraw on Board to clarify\nAdditionally, if we paste any braid with the braid of just straight ribbons, nothing happens. This tells us that braids can be given the structure of a group.Group\nA group consists of a collection of objects , thought of as symmetries of some underlying structure, together with a distinguished symmetry and a composition operation combining two symmetries. This data is subject to the following conditions: The distinguished symmetry is the do-nothing symmetry in the sense that for any other symmetry , .\nFor every symmetry in , an inverse symmetry such that .\nThe order in which a sequence of symmetries is combined two-at-a-time is independent of the resulting combined symmetry. For example, given a triple of symmetries in , we have the equality of symmetries Example The integers with addition is a group.\nThe rotational symmetries of a square (or triangle, circle, etc.) form a group.\nThe set of non-zero fractions forms a group with multiplication.\nThe permutations of -points form a group Translations of the plane form a group Question\nDoes the order in which we paste braids matter?\nYes!! This means that the braid group, , is not a commutative group. <br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.4051\" target=\"_self\">Tutorial on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-1-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0409205\" target=\"_self\">Survey on Braid Groups</a><a href=\"#fnref-2-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~jchw/RTG-Braids.pdf\" target=\"_self\">RTG-Braids.pdf</a><a href=\"#fnref-3-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/singaporetutorial.pdf\" target=\"_self\">singapore tutorial Ghrist.dvi</a> <a href=\"#fnref-4-c880ad5971f86451\" class=\"footnote-backref footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">↩︎</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Learning Objectives","level":2,"id":"Learning_Objectives_0"},{"heading":"Mathematical Braids (c.f.1234)","level":2,"id":"Mathematical_Braids_(c.f.[^1][^2][^3][^4])_0"},{"heading":"References","level":4,"id":"References_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-1-mathematical-braids.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["images/pasted-image-20250912211705.png","images/pasted-image-20250912215930.png","images/pasted-image-20250912222003.png","images/pasted-image-20250912222605.png"],"createdTime":1757298213479,"modifiedTime":1757864671822,"sourceSize":10077,"sourcePath":"Math Outreach Notes/Math Circle Notes/Braid Groups/Lesson 1 - Mathematical Braids.md","exportPath":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/lesson-1-mathematical-braids.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":13,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/math525_reflection2.html":{"title":"Math525_Reflection2","icon":"","description":"","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/math525_reflection2.html","pathToRoot":"../../..","attachments":["math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/math525_reflection2.html"],"createdTime":1757298464105,"modifiedTime":1757298464900,"sourceSize":216864,"sourcePath":"Math Outreach Notes/Math Circle Notes/Braid Groups/Math525_Reflection2.pdf","exportPath":"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/math525_reflection2.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":14,"backlinks":[],"type":"attachment"},"math-outreach-notes/math-circle-notes/braid-groups/outline-of-lessons.html":{"title":"Outline of Lessons","icon":"","description":"Outline of Content:\nLecture 1: Introduce braids as a physical concept, and discuss how we can interpret it mathematically, as well as some applications of this Start with -braids, then -braids, and see if the students can generalize to -braids\nIn physical motivation, discussion braids as particle dances and do the ribbon activity\nInterpret both mathematically The original one will be \"strings\" in 3D space with one direction being time\nThen non-colliding particles, Mention connection between braids and knots/links\nHave the students check associativity, unitality, and existence of inverses in a guided exercise, before indicating that what they've done is find the definition of a group! (write this out on the board) Give them some other examples they might know (i.e. integers and addition, rotations of triangles, rotations of the circle, ...) Lecture 2: Recall main points from previous lecture In particular, recall braid composition, and how it forms a group Ask the question of whether we can get all braids by some finite number of braids\nGive the third description of the braid group using generators and relations Maybe do exercise 1.5 or 1.6 in1?\nDo Exercise 1.11 Maybe talk about Pure braids and permutations, and how arises (in informal language)\nThen recall the particle perspective about braids, and talk about how and can be formalized in terms of configuration spaces Remark about connections to robotics\nTry vizualizing the configuration space for the letter . Remark about deforming configuration spaces without changing braid groups Lecture 3: Word problems!!! Recall braids as a group and the definition of a group\nMention the Word Problem for a group with a presentation, and how it is in general unsolvable\nBreakdown the solution to the word problem in into bite-size steps\nIf there is time prove that the braid groups are torsion free2 Mention how visually this might be intuitive, but it is quite hard to make mathematically precise Regard as (mapping class group of disk with -punctures), where we choose the punctures to be spaced evenly along the interval on the -axis. The image of under a homeomorphism fixing the boundary splits the disk into two halves. If and are two such homeomorphism, we can then define if for (the being the punctures), and an initial segment of lies in the upper component of the disk when halved by This defines a left-invariant ordering, from which we can show has no torsion elements.
