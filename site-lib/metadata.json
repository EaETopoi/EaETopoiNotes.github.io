Let be as defined previously, and consider the colimit of the diagram in given below:Then can be diagrammatically summarized by The product consists of five copies of , denoted , and , together with (non-unital) loose hom-bimodules , , and , tight hom-bimodules and , and for any -cell in a -cellwhere the subscripts are used to specify in which copy each object, tight arrow, and loose arrow lives. Similarly has nine copies of , six copies of , five copies of , along two kinds of -cells as above, one special kind of -cells, and a -cell for any -cell in .On the other hand, the colimit of the diagramalso has nine copies of , six copies of , five copies of , and the same two kinds of -cells, and -cells, but only -cells which arise as formal compositessubject to the associativity constraint which for a pasting diagramsays that the two orders of composing, namely composing the center cells with the upper ones versus composing the center cells with the lower one, yield the same formal -cell.As is assumed exponentiable, preserves colimits so that the canonical VD functor must be an isomorphism. Thus, any -ary cell in must decompose as above, with this decomposition being unique up to the equivalence relation generated by the associativity constraint above. More generally, for any and any with , we must have that any -ary cell in decomposes as a compositewhere , and such that this decomposition is unique up to an associativity for composing cells in the center of the pasting diagram, as in the case for , just considered.For instance, if we instead consider the pushoutso that can be summarized diagrammatically asThen similarly, the canonical map must be an isomorphism, which stipulates that every unary cell in must decompose aswith this decomposition being unique up to the same kind of associativity condition given previously in the case of . Inductively, we get decomposition of -multicells through -multicells which are unique up to associativity.: Conversely, suppose is a VDC such that for each with , each -multicell decomposes as a composite of -multicells with an -multicell, and the decomposition is unique up to associativity. Let be any other VDC. Define the underlying box-graph of be defined in terms of the description given previously for objects, tight arrows, loose arrows, and multicells. It remains to define a unital and associative scheme for pasting multicells. Suppose we have a pasting schemeso that and are VD functors, where .

Naturality follows from functoriality of the , , and . Associativity of the composition then follows from associativity of the composition in . Further, for any loose arrow , we have the identity cell corresponding to the VD functor which sends a unary cell in toFrom our definition of composition in above, and the functoriality of -multicells, it follows that these unary cells act as identities under vertical pasting.Finally, to show that the VDC is indeed a power in , let be another VDC. Note that since tight transformations correspond to VD functors , it suffices to prove the -dimensional universal property. Then we define the mapby sending a VD functor to the VD functor given as follows:\nAn object is sent to the functor which sends an object to and a tight arrow to .\nA tight arrow is sent to the natural transformation given at an object by , so that naturality follows from functoriality of .\nA loose arrow is sent to the map of (non-unital) loose bimodules with domain and target actions and , respectively, along with carrier functor sending a loose arrow to and sending a unary cell to An -multicell in is sent to the -multicell which acts on an -multicell in by .\nThe functoriality of and definition of cellular composition in ensures that this indeed produces a VD functor.

Let denote the sub-2-category of pro-representable VDCs. Let's start by showing that all representable VDCs are pro-representable:Proposition 3 (Representable Implies Pro-Representable).\nRepresentable VDCs are pro-representable.\nProof.\nLet be a representable VDC. Since has all cocartesian cells, the functionsare all surjective. To show they are bijective, consider a decomposition of a multi-cell in where . It suffices to show that the decomposition above right is equivalent to the canonical decompositionUsing the universal property of cocartesian cells we can factor the first decomposition as follows:The uniqueness in factorizations through cocartesian cells ensures that the composite cell below the cocartesian cells on the right must be equal to , and hence the two decompositions are equivalent up to associativity.\nâ–¡For instance, this says that for any category , the tight VDC is pro-representable and the unital VDC is pro-representable. For example, the walking object VDC is pro-representable, with is the chaotic VDC associated to the category (i.e. we add a unique loose arrow between all objects, and a unique cell filling all squares). This fits into a triple adjunction<br>In particular, we easily obtain the well-known results that limits and colimits in are given by limits and colimits in on the level of tight categories. On the other hand, because the non-unital loose arrow is not exponentiable (c.f. <a data-href=\"Exponentiating (A)VDCs#^266992\" href=\"reading-notes/category-theory/double-categories/virtual-double-categories/exponentiating-(a)vdcs.html#^266992\" class=\"original-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" style=\"display: none;\">Exponentiating (A)VDCs &gt; ^266992</a><a data-href=\"Exponentiating (A)VDCs#^266992\" href=\"reading-notes/category-theory/double-categories/virtual-double-categories/exponentiating-(a)vdcs.html#^266992\" class=\"internal-link mathLink-internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Example 11 ( is not Pro-representable)</a>) although we have an adjunctionthe functor does not admit a right adjoint, as it doesn't preserve arbitrary colimits. Our next goal is to find some examples of pro-representable VDCs. First let's consider the following construction of new pro-representable VDCs from old ones:Construction 4 (Tight Bimodule Associated to Map of Pro-Representable VDCs).\nLet be a VD functor between pro-representable VDCs. Then we can define a tight bimodule by taking its companion in the virtual equipment . Recall that this is equivalent to a VD category with a VD functor into the unital tight arrow. Then is also pro-representable as a VDC.\nProof.\nIt suffices to show that we have essentially unique decompositions of heterocells. But heterocells are precisely multi-cells of the formin , which can be decomposed uniquely up to associativity since is pro-representable. Since also contains a copy of , in order for to be pro-representable we also need to be pro-representable.\nâ–¡If is not pro-representable, we can always restrict the tight bimodule along the inclusion of a sub-VDC which is pro-representable in order to get a pro-representable VDC . We now show that a maximal such sub-VDC always exists:Proposition 5 ( is stable under filtered colimits). is stable under filtered colimits.\nProof.â–¡To give some novel examples or pro-representable VDCs, let's recall a characterization of pro-monoidal categories.Theorem 6 (Characterization of Pro-monoidal Categories).\nLet be a symmetric monoidal closed category with all limits and colimits together with a normalization . A small -category underlies a pro-representable multi-category if and only if is a biclosed -category, with a choice of biclosed structure corresponding to a pro-representable multi-category with underlying category .\nProof.\nTBC\nâ–¡Example 7 (Cartesian Closed presheaf Categories).\nRecall that any presheaf category has the structure of a cartesian closed category, with and , where . Thus, any small category underlies a pro-representable multicategory. Namely, the multi-category associated to the cartesian closed structure on , , has objects those of , and has multi-morphisms defined inductively. We have a single nullary morphism for each object . Then if the -ary morphisms are defined for some , we can define the -ary morphisms as the co-endThus, , and so inductivelyIt follows that the multicategory is representable if and only if has finite coproducts.Example 8 ( for a discrete category).\nIf is a discrete category, then is the multicategory with two objects, and , for which If instead of being a discrete category we had be the walking parallel arrows , thenRecall that we have an embedding of the 2-category of multicategories into the 2-category of VDCs given by sending a multicategory to the VDC whose underlying tight category is the terminal category , whose loose arrows are objects in , and whose cells are multimorphisms in . The multicategories sent to pro-representable VDCs are precisely the pro-representable multicategories, so that this embedding restricts to an embedding .<br>Now we have two sources of pro-representable virtual double categories: promonoidal categories, and representable VDCs.

Thus, we recover Pare's VDC of VD functors, tight transformations, modules, and multi-modulations.<br>We will begin with an example motivated by the promonoidal category governing symmetric monoidal categories in<a data-footref=\"2\" href=\"#fn-2-bc890c7ac0193c34\" class=\"footnote-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">[2]</a>. First, we construct a promonoidal category for coloured pros. Recall that a coloured pro consists of the following data: (find reference - right now adapting hackney and robertson's definition of coloured props)\nA set of colours For every ordered list of colours , a set of operations A specified element for each An associative vertical composition An associative horizontal composition satisfying unitality and four-interchange axioms. Coloured props additionally have symmetry actions on domains and codomains which are compatible with compositions.\nWe can define a promonoidal category governing coloured props in a precise sense. Objects are pairs of objects in (= the simplex category with a free initial object), while the hom-set is given byProposition 9 (Cospans give Pro-representable VDCs).\nFor any category , the VDC is pro-representable, and is representable if and only if admits finite pushouts.\nProof.\nThe second claim is well-known so let's consider the first claim. To begin consider an -cell in which equates to a commuting diagram of the formand let be the unique maps for the middle 's. First let's show existence of decompositions. If for . If there is nothing to do. If , and , then we can factor it aswhere , and for , if we insert the nullary cellIf (or similarly for ) we insert the nullary cellon the left (resp. right) the the bottom cell becomesSo far this proves surjectivity of our laxators. To prove injectivity we need uniqueness. However, this follows from the fact that any other decomposition is equivalent up to associativity to this one by sliding the bottom cell up. For example, in the case an arbitrary decomposition below left is equivalent to the canonical decomposition through an associativity pasting in the center:â–¡Proposition 10 ( preserves exponentiability).\nIf is a pro-representable VDC, then so is .\nProof.â–¡Example 11 ( is not Pro-representable).\nThe non-unital walking loose arrow is not a pro-representable VDC. This can be shown by providing a colimit that doesn't preserve. Consider the diagram and resulting colimit in below: Let denote the colimit. Then has two distinct unary non-identity cells. On the other hand, if we take the product with before taking the colimit, then the result only has a single non-identity unary cell\nIn this section we aim to adapt the previous argument for exponentiable VDCs to AVDCs. We write , , , for the AVDC given by a single multi-cellFurther, let denote the AVDC with no loose arrows, a single non-identity tight arrow, and no cells non-identity globular cells, and similarly let denote the AVDC with no non-identity tight arrows, a single loose arrow between distinct objects, and no non-identity cells. Then AVD functors are exactly the multi-cells in with -length source and -length target, while AVD functors and are precisely tight and loose arrows in , respectively. More generally, if is a 2-category, let denote the AVDC with tight 2-category , and no loose arrows, and let denote the AVDC with discrete tight category , one loose arrow for each morphism in , and special cells those in .Now, suppose and are AVDCs for which the exponent exists. Then must consist of the following data:\nObjects are 2-functors .\nTight arrows are 2-natural transformations between 2-functors Loose arrows consist of a pair of 2-functors together with, for each unary cell in , a unary cell which is functorial in the tight direction and natural with respect to globular cells. Equivalently this is a map of (non-unital) loose bimodules Multi-cells correspond to 2-functors , , maps of (non-unital) loose bimodules if and a map of non-unital loose bimodules if , 2-natural transformations and , and for each -multicell in an -multicell\nsatisfying the pasting identity:Proposition 12 (Exponentiable AVDCs).\nThe exponentiable AVDCs are those whose cells admit unbiased decompositions that are unique up to associativity.\nProof.\n: Suppose is an exponentiable AVDC. Let , such that . Then let be the diagram depicted below:where the middle vertical arrows pick out the loose target of the unique non-identity multi-cell, the top arrows pick out tight sources and targets of the multi-cells, and the bottom maps picks out the -th object in the loose source of the unique non-identity multi-cell, and if it also picks out the loose arrow with that object as source.Let . Then can be diagrammatically summarized by where underlines are used to indicate (possibly empty) sequences of loose arrows. Note that the product consists of copies of , denoted , and , together with copies of (non-unital) loose hom-bimodule , copies of the tight hom-bimodule , and for any -cell in , an associated -cell.

Then we define the mapby sending a VD functor to the VD functor given as follows:\nAn object is sent to the functor which sends an object to and a tight arrow to .\nA tight arrow is sent to the natural transformation given at an object by , so that naturality follows from functoriality of .\nA loose arrow is sent to the map of (non-unital) loose bimodules with domain and target actions and , respectively, along with carrier functor sending a loose arrow to and sending a unary cell to An -multicell in is sent to the -multicell which acts on an -multicell in by .\nThe functoriality of and definition of cellular composition in ensures that this indeed produces a VD functor.

Since has all cocartesian cells, the functionsare all surjective. To show they are bijective, consider a decomposition of a multi-cell in where . It suffices to show that the decomposition above right is equivalent to the canonical decompositionUsing the universal property of cocartesian cells we can factor the first decomposition as follows:The uniqueness in factorizations through cocartesian cells ensures that the composite cell below the cocartesian cells on the right must be equal to , and hence the two decompositions are equivalent up to associativity.\nâ–¡In this subsection prove that we have a closed monoidal structure on , with inner hom given by the AVDC of AVD-functors, lax AVD transformations, AVD modules, and AVD multimodulations.
