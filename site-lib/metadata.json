In the language of two-sided double fibrations these two pseudo-functors on symmetric monoidal loose bimodules correspond to andIn particular, we see that we get a natural comparison map\nClaim: This extends into a pseudo-natural transformation .\nRecall that given a two-sided double fibration , the associated loose bimodule has for and those loose arrows which are objects of lying over and on the left and right.

The collapse corresponds to the (not necessarily discrete) two-sided fibration , or the profunctor , or the bimodule .\nWe now discuss a bimodule-oriented notion of loose adjunction.Definition 11 (Loose Adjunction).\nGiven virtual double functors , a lax loose adjunction between them consists of an adjunction of loose bimodules . <br>Libkind, S., Jaz Meyers, D., Carlson, K.
